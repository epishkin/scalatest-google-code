add info functionality to Spec

add GivenWhenThen trait

Add FeatureSuite trait. Title goes to constructor? I think I have this more figured out somewhere else. But where?

  As a "bla", I want "bla", So that "bla" plus scenarious

Scenarios are like FuNSuite, but with scenario instead of test. Could use a code gen from FunSuite to Scenarios trait, but I don't
think I'll have a Scenarios trait, just a FeatureSuite one. FeatureSuite will extend GivenWhenThen.
