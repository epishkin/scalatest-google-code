Maybe throw StackDepthExceptions for any kind of error in test code.

Only allow ignore to replace it in FlatSpec tests that start with it. (45 min.)

Rename ScalaCheck back to Checkers? (later)

Do the "pending" thing in InfoProvided. Probably just add a fromPendingTest Boolean to it. So that I can turn the given when thens yellow that came from a pending test. (1 hour)

Text:
Test fixtures:
fixture, the best approach => immutable fixture, one approach
it needs to be recreated => they need to be recreated
setup => setUp
BeforeAndAfter => BeforeAndAfterEach
consider two approaches => consider some approaches

Move the verb stuff to a org.scalatest.verb package? It really has nothing to do with matchers. (30 min)

Add tests and error messages for the dynamic error of registering a test that takes no fixture in one
that requires fixtures, and vice versa, for WordSpec and FlatSpec, or at least just FlatSpec.

In RunnerSuite, 'parseConfigSet was 'parseCOnfigSet, and it was passing, which tells me if invokePrivate
doesn't find the requested method name maybe it isn't failing. It needs to fail. No, I think the problem
was probably simply that tools wasn't being run.

Turn off tags in JUnitComfortSuite? At least until 0.9.8 when I turn on TagAnnotation?

Add back in Report and SpecReport. Put deprecated final execute methods in that forward as best they can to the regular one, though
perhaps I just need the final execute forms for the interpreter and the one public execute. Make a trait that can be mixed into
Reporter called TransitionalReporter, which has an apply method that forwards to the old methods, so people can bring existing reporters
up to date with a quick mix in. Or, consider whether I can just do that directly in Reporter itself. Oh, no, because then people's would
extensions would automatically work. No, that's OK. Just deprecate all the old testStarting, etc., methods.

Write tests for JUnitComfort Suite.

Probably make an org.scalatest.junit.AssertionsForJUnit3 trait that provides the same syntax as org.scalatest.Assertions, but
throws an AssertionFailedError, which will cause JUnit 3 to record it as a failure not an error.

Possibly have TestFailedException extend AssertionError, just for the heck of it? Because it seems like an assert method should
actually throw an AssertionError.

Document JUnitComfortSuite.

Put an Option[Nothing] in the run methods as a placeholder for the OutErrTester kind of stuff. Whatever that object is
that's getting passed around. OutErrManager maybe. Wierd, could even provide overloaded versions. Wait, I could do that
anyway. Just add it at the end later, and make.., no because then it would have to be final.
OutputManager, OutputTester. Those seem nicer. Anyway, it is for another day. OutputTester

Someone complained that if they configured the graphic reporter, that it should show that configuration by default not
just runs and failures. Not sure.

Do more testing on the FilterReporter config stuff.

Try sorting the GUI reports with the ordinal

I think I want to deprecate the use of -x for tags to exclude, to use it for XML Reporter. So in 0.9.6, -x should
still work, but so will some new one. And I'll warn folks that probably in 0.9.7, -x will start meaning xml reporter.

Refactor SuiteRerunner to just create a tools.SuiteRunner and call run on that. Maybe SuiteRunner should be in org.scalatest,
because it is also used by Distributor and will be used by SuiteRerunner.

add a RandomTestOrder trait?

put goodies in ant task as well as properties for two releases, then drop properties
Change description of includes --> tagsToInclude,
excludes --> tagsToExclude. Leave old one in for two releases.

Add the things for Property based testing displaying args nicely in the GUI (like empty strings should be "")

The eating error message problem. Make sure an exception message shows up in the GUI/Print output.

I'm not printing out the message in a formatted report, just the exception's detail message

Do an XML reporter and an HTML reporter

Make everything private in ScalaTestTask that can be private. I see a few things that are public I think unnecessarily.

The enter-after-be issue:
love the scala-test BDD-DSL (only weird thing was a false possitive 
when I added an enter after a "be" 
be 
( 
instead of 
be ( 
The first case always passes :/ It would be better if it always failed. 


Ask folks about run versus execute
Ask folks about TestCase/Suite compatibility (check about testNames, because if that doesn't work it really is a non-starter)
Ask folks about the beforeAll and afterAll in BeforeAndAfter
Ask folks about JUnit error instead of failures being fired

a *** file-system separator separated runpath (platform-runpath)
b
c - concurrent execution (--concurrent)
d
e - standard error reporter (--stderr-reporter)
f - file reporter
g - graphical reporter
h *** HTML Reporter

For HTML reporter, can pick a style sheet? Could be -hC for Colorful, else get pretty one like cobertura

-w and -m could take an option "Q" for quick discovery that uses naming conventions. It would only load
classes whose .class file names end in Spec or Suite.

George list:

1. Update build.xml. Right now compile and test only builds and tests
ShouldMatchers. You have to run gencode by hand and then recompile and
test to get MustMatchers, because MustMatchers is generated from
ShouldMatchers. Please modify the ant file so default task builds all
(test builds and tests all, compile compiles all, including the
MustMatchers). Then add a qbuild and qcompile that skips the gencode
so I can do quicker builds. It takes 5 minutes to do a full build
without MustMatchers, so that's long enough. Also, if it will work,
can you make a clean target that doesn't delete the matcher tests,
because that's what takes forever to compile. Maybe a qclean?

2. Modify ant task
- Add goodies to the ant task (leaving in properties as "deprecated"
for two releases) I renamed properties to goodies because there are
two other things called properties in ScalaTest (HavePropertyMatchers
and ScalaCheck property checks). Also, one guy thought properties
specified that way should be Java system properties. Calling them
goodies should avoid that confusion as well.
- Add tagsToInclude to the ant task (leaving in includes as
"deprecated" for two releases), to bring ant task in line with new
name.
- Add tagsToExclude to the ant task (leaving in excludes as
"deprecated" for two releases), to bring ant task in line with new
name.
- Add a -a runpath command line option, (also in the ant task but I'm
not sure under what name). Idea is that -p takes a space-separated
runpath, which works fine except when people have spaces in their
paths. I want to keep -p as is, because you can specify jar files with
URLs in there, but also provide another way to specify the runpath -a,
that uses the traditional path separated by platform-specific
separator character. (On Unix, a :, on Windows, a;, etc.) Please
suggest a name for this, maybe platformRunpath or something.
- Create a JUnitWrapperSuite, which can wrap an existing set of JUnit
tests, probably written in Java, but already compiled to binary
- Recommend something to do with -j. What I'd like people to be able
to do is use -j to point ScalaTest's Runner to some existing JUnit
tests, and have it create the JUnitWrapperSuite necessary to run them
from within ScalaTest.
- The JUnit Ant task does some discovery. I think it relies on things
being named Test. I'd like to be able to tell people they can do the
exact same discovery of JUnit tests with ScalaTest's ant task as they
can with JUnit's ant task. That way it is a migration path forward.
They should be able to run those old JUnit tests with similar stuff in
the ScalaTest ant task that they now put in the JUnit ant task.
- Add a "quick" option for suite discovery. Suite discovery takes a
long time already for ScalaTest testing itself, because Scala
generates so many darn class files. We're opening every single one
looking for suites. I think if they add a Q to their -w or -m's, like
-wQ or -mQ, then that batch should be done based on naming convention.
ScalaTest will only even open class files that end in either "Spec" or
"Suite" looking for classes that extend org.scalatest.Suite. We could
add Test in there if people request it, but frankly these classes
represent suites of tests not single tests usually, so I'd like to try
and get them out of the JUnit habit of calling the classes XTest. Plus
it helps differentiate when discovering in packages that have mixed
JUnit tests and ScalaTest Suites, which would speed up both kinds of
discovery.

3. Surefire support.
- Maven uses something called SureFire to run tests. A fellow named
Jan has started some integration here. Once you get to this point, let
me know and I'll find out where Jan is at so you can see if you want
to start there. I don't know much about SureFire, but I think we need
to support Maven as well as Ant to get Maven people to use ScalaTest.

4. HTML and XML reporters
- Dianne is doing an HTML reporter, so when you get to this one, let
me know and I'll see where she's at. But one thing is we want a -h
command line param to run the HTML reporter, and also add this to the
ant task.
- Do an XML reporter that always prints out everything no matter what
it is configured with. Print out the ordinal and everything. The
reason is this can be used as an output during concurrent tests which
can be read in and then sorted to produce other output.

"A Stack (with one item)" should behave like nonEmptyStack(lastValuePushed)(stackWithOneItem)
it should behave like nonFullStack(stackWithOneItem)

In FlatSpec, just support "it should behave like X" and if ShouldMatchers is mixed in "string should behave like X". No shared tests needed.
In Spec, just support "it should behave like X." No SharedTests mix in needed. So it("test name") will have to be an apply method on
the it object.

ask about sugar forms for shouldEqual and mustEqual to Should/MustMatchers:

    stack.peek mustEqual lastItemAdded
    stack.size mustEqual size
    
    stack.peek shouldEqual lastItemAdded
    stack.size shouldEqual size
    
    stack.peek must_== lastItemAdded
    stack.size must_== size
    
    stack.peek should_== lastItemAdded
    stack.size should_== size

Put these into ShouldEqual and MustEqual traits, which Should/MustMatchers mix in. So that way people can get
them by themselves if they want? Or maybe not. Just add them to the Matchers traits.
    
0.9.7
Do the parallel afterAll thing.
Add BeforeAndAfterEach, BeforeAndAfterAll. Make BeforeAndAfter just an extension of BeforeAndAfterEach and BeforeAndAfterAll and deprecate it.
BeforeAndAfterAll will need to look for some object sent down in goodies from OneInstancePerTest, so it knows not to do it if it is an
"isolated test instance" or something. And then it will also have to turn off the distributor. This would mean that DistributedTestExecution
would not happen if there's an AfterAll right now. Later, what I could do is BeforeAndAfterAll wraps the distributor, if it is defined, in
an AfterAllDistributor. And that guy would wrap the suites that are put into it in a SuiteWrapper that forwards the run invocation but when
it completes (in a finally) it notifies an AfterAllActor. This react actor knows which notifications to wait for, and when they are all done, it
executes the after all method. So my theory is that since I'm using react, these actors won't hold up threads. But what tangled complexity we weave when
we first learn to parallelize.

Don't do the OneArgXXX traits

From the SharedTests trait:

/**
 * Trait that enables the same tests to be run on different fixture objects. In other words, it enables tests to be "shared"
 * by different fixture objects.
 *
 * <p>
 * To use the <code>SharedTests</code> trait, you first place shared tests in <em>behavior functions</em>. These behavior functions will be
 * invoked during the construction phase of any suite that uses them, so that the tests they contain will be registered as tests in that suite.
 * The <code>SharedTests</code>, therefore, can only be used in suites in which tests are represented by function values registered
 * during suite object construction, such as ScalaTest's <code>FunSuite</code> and <code>Spec</code> classes. By contrast, trait
 * <code>SharedTests</code>  can't be mixed into suites such as ScalaTest's <code>Suite</code>, <code>JUnitSuite</code>, or
 * <code>TestNGSuite</code>, in which tests are represented by methods. Any attempt to mix <code>SharedTests</code> into any such
 * suite will not compile, because they don't conform to <code>SharedTest</code>'s self type, <code>TestRegistration</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, given this stack class:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class Stack[T] {
 *
 *   val MAX = 10
 *   private var buf = new ListBuffer[T]
 *
 *   def push(o: T) {
 *     if (!full)
 *       o +: buf
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't push onto a full stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def pop(): T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf.remove(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def peek: T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def full: Boolean = buf.size == MAX
 *   def empty: Boolean = buf.size == 0
 *   def size = buf.size
 *
 *   override def toString = buf.mkString("Stack(", ", ", ")")
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You may want to test the <code>Stack</code> class in different states: empty, full, with one item, with one item less than capacity,
 * <em>etc</em>. You may find you have several tests that make sense any time the stack is non-empty. Thus you'd ideally want to run
 * those same tests for three stack fixture objects: a full stack, a stack with a one item, and a stack with one item less than
 * capacity. With <code>SharedTests</code>, you can factor these tests out into a behavior function, into which you pass the
 * stack fixture to use when running the tests. So in your test suite for stack, you'd invoke the
 * behavior function three times, passing in each of the three stack fixtures so that the shared tests are run for all three fixtures. You
 * can define a behavior function that encapsulates these shared tests inside the suite you use them. If they are shared
 * between different suites, however, you could also define them in a separate trait that is mixed into each suite that uses them.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <a name="StackBehaviors">For</a> example, here the <code>nonEmptyStack</code> behavior function (here a behavior <em>method</em>) is defined in a trait along with another
 * method containing shared tests for non-full stacks:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * trait StackBehaviors { this: Spec =>
 * 
 *   def nonEmptyStack(lastItemAdded: Int)(stack: Stack[Int]) {
 * 
 *     it("should be non-empty") {
 *       assert(!stack.empty)
 *     }  
 * 
 *     it("should return the top item on peek") {
 *       assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
 *     }
 *   
 *     it("should not remove the top item on peek") {
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size)
 *     }
 *   
 *     it("should remove the top item on pop") {
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.pop === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size - 1)
 *     }
 *   }
 *   
 *   def nonFullStack(stack: Stack[Int]) {
 *       
 *     it("should not be full") {
 *       assert(!stack.full)
 *     }
 *       
 *     it("should add to the top on push") {
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       stack.push(7)
 *       assert(stack.size === size + 1)
 *       assert(stack.peek === 7)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * In a behavior function, the fixture object must be passed in its own parameter list. If the shared tests need nothing more than
 * the fixture object, then the fixture object's parameter list is the only parameter list, as in the <code>nonFullStack</code>
 * method from the previous example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * def nonFullStack(stack: Stack[Int])
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * However, if the shared tests need other information in addition to the fixture object, that information must be
 * passed in a separate parameter list. The behavior function must in that case be curried, with the parameter list
 * for the fixture object coming last, as in the <code>nonEmptyStack</code> method from the previous example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * def nonEmptyStack(lastItemAdded: Int)(stack: Stack[Int])
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given these behavior functions, you could invoke them directly, but <code>SharedTests</code> offers a DSL for the purpose,
 * which looks like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ensure (stackWithOneItem) behaves like (nonEmptyStack(lastValuePushed))
 * ensure (stackWithOneItem) behaves like (nonFullStack)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you prefer to use an imperative style to change fixtures, for example by mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> and
 * reassigning a <code>stack</code> <code>var</code> in <code>beforeEach</code>, you could write your behavior functions
 * in the context of that <code>var</code>, which means you wouldn't need to pass in the stack fixture because it would be
 * in scope already inside the behavior function. In that case, you can
 * use <code>it</code> in place of the fixture object, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ensure it behaves like nonEmptyStack // assuming lastValuePushed is also in scope inside nonEmptyStack
 * ensure it behaves like nonFullStack
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The recommended style, however, is the functional, pass-all-the-needed-values-in style. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * class SharedTestExampleSpec extends Spec with SharedTests with StackBehaviors {
 * 
 *   // Stack fixture creation methods
 *   def emptyStack = new Stack[Int]
 * 
 *   def fullStack = {
 *     val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *     for (i <- 0 until stack.MAX)
 *       stack.push(i)
 *     stack
 *   }
 * 
 *   def stackWithOneItem = {
 *     val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *     stack.push(9)
 *     stack
 *   }
 * 
 *   def stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity = {
 *     val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *     for (i <- 1 to 9)
 *       stack.push(i)
 *     stack
 *   }
 * 
 *   val lastValuePushed = 9
 * 
 *   describe("A Stack") {
 * 
 *     describe("(when empty)") {
 *       
 *       it("should be empty") {

 *       }
 * 
 *       it("should complain on peek") {
 *         intercept[IllegalStateException] {
 *           emptyStack.peek
 *         }
 *       }
 * 
 *       it("should complain on pop") {

 *           fullStack.push(10)
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you load these classes into the Scala interpreter (with scalatest's JAR file on the class path), and execute it,
 * you'll see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scala> (new StackSpec).execute()

 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Obtaining unique test names</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * One thing to keep in mind when using shared tests is that in ScalaTest, each test in a suite must have a unique name.
 * If you register the same tests repeatedly in the same suite, one problem you may encounter is an exception at runtime
 * complaining that multiple tests are being registered with the same test name. A good way to solve this problem in a <code>Spec</code> is to surround
 * each invocation of a behavior function with a <code>describe</code> clause, which will prepend a string to each test name.
 * For example, the following code in a <code>Spec</code> would register a test with the name <code>"A Stack (when empty) should be empty"</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   describe("A Stack") {
 * 
 *     describe("(when empty)") {
 *       
 *       it("should be empty") {
 *         assert(emptyStack.empty)
 *       }
 *       // ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the <code>"should be empty"</code> tests were factored out into a behavior function, it could be called repeatedly so long
 * as each invocation of the behavior function is inside a different set of <code>describe</code> clauses. In a <code>FunSuite</code>
 * there is no nesting construct analogous to <code>Spec</code>'s <code>describe</code> clause. If the duplicate test name problem shows up in a
 * <code>FunSuite</code>, you'll need to pass in a prefix or suffix string to add to each test name. You can pass this string
 * the same way you pass any other data needed by the shared tests, or just call <code>toString</code> on the shared fixture object.
 * Here's an example of how <code>StackBehaviors</code> might look for a <code>FunSuite</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * trait StackBehaviors { this: FunSuite =>
 * 
 *   def nonEmptyStack(lastItemAdded: Int)(stack: Stack[Int]) {
 * 
 *     test(stack.toString + " should be non-empty") {
 *       assert(!stack.empty)
 *     }  
 * 
 *     test(stack.toString + " should return the top item on peek") {
 *       assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
 *     }
 *   
 *     test(stack.toString + " should not remove the top item on peek") {
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size)
 *     }
 *   
 *     test(stack.toString + " should remove the top item on pop") {
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.pop === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size - 1)
 *     }
 *   }
 *   
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given this <code>StackBahaviors</code> trait, calling it with the <code>stackWithOneItem</code> fixture:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ensure (stackWithOneItem) behaves like (nonEmptyStack(lastValuePushed))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * would yield test names:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>Stack(9) should be non-empty</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9) should return the top item on peek</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9) should not remove the top item on peek</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9) should remove the top item on pop</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Whereas calling it with the <code>stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity</code> fixture:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * ensure (stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity) behaves like (nonEmptyStack(lastValuePushed))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * would yield different test names:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) should be non-empty</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) should return the top item on peek</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) should not remove the top item on peek</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) should remove the top item on pop</code></li>

Thoughts on OutputManager. I would replace System.err and System.out with PrintStreams that are connected
to the OutputManager, which I pass in a Some to run. You can register a listener with the OutputManager and
unregister it. While registered, it will receive one "event" per call to the PrintStream methods. So I'd
do the loan pattern to basically say capture the thing. 

val myListener = new OutputListener
outMan.addListener(myListener)
try {
  // Some code
}
finally {
  outMan.removeListener(myListener)
}

Can make a trait that has a withListener method:

val myListener = new OutputListener
outMan.withListener(myListener) { // Maybe listens to both std err and std out
}
outMan.withOutputListener(myListener) { // Maybe listens to only std out
}
outMan.withErrorListener(myListener) { // Maybe listens to only std err
}

Then in all my runTest methods, whew, I would have a:

outputManager match {
case None =>
case Some 

yuck. Basically probably out an OutputManager, which does nothing with the listener if it is not listening

So this listener could be an OutputCollector, and I could pass it in goodies as "org.scalatest.OutputCollector"

Man, need to say just my thread or all threads.

outMan.withListenerAllThreads(myListener) { // Maybe listens to both std err and std out
}
outMan.withOutputListenerAllThreads(myListener) { // Maybe listens to only std out
}
outMan.withErrorListenerAllThreads(myListener) { // Maybe listens to only std err
}

Would want to give the Dispatcher's thread a unique name so it can not show up. Blech. Very ugly and complicated. Side effect city.

Yes, I think this makes sense. Only offer the withListener approach, because otherwise people could forget
to unregister a listener. The Listener is a trait, and I can offer a BufferListener, that is in=memory. But people
could put a file listener in there too if they wanted to write one. Could be called A Collector. Because that's really
what it is doing as it listens is collects. So I really need OutputManager to be a trait that has a do nothing one
and a real one.


outputAndError.captureWith(collector) {
}

capture stdOutAndErrWith collector {
}

capture stdOutWith collector {
}

val collector = new BufferCollector
capture stdErrWith collector {
}

import outMan._

stdErr.capture(collector) {
}

outMan.collectStdErr(collector)

collect(stdErr) {
}

Collector can be a function that takes a thing that is either stdErr, stdOut, or stdOutAndErr, which
could be members of outMan. The collect method could also be a member of outMan. So could say:

import outMan._

vall collect = new BufCollector

collect(stdErr) {
}

val stdErr = new BufCollector

outMan.collect(stdErr) {
}

val stdErr = outMan.collectStdErr {
}

import outMan._
val stdErr =
  collectStdErr {
  }

stdErr.all should include "expected output"
Actually, stdErr could simply be a List[String], right? Or a Seq[String].

Then could offer another collectStdErr method that takes a Collector. This one provides a collector that
buffers stuff in memory.

val seq =
  collectStandardError {
  }

assert(seq.find("bla") != -1)

Could offer a CollectorFixture that will fail if there's no Collector. Else it passes it in,
and tests can do tests based on standard input and output.
