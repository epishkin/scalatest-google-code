name reporter reporter, distributor distributor, and stopper stopper in all things
Use filter in the run methods
ask folks about run versus execute
ask folks about TestCase/Suite compatibility (check about testNames, because if that doesn't work it really is a non-starter)
use events, not reports, in GUI reporter
drop Report and SpecReport to make sure it is really gone
Complete JUnitSuite, JUnitRunner
Do JUnitWrapperSuite and the command line param
Create a command line param that takes regular "classpath" style runpath, so path names with spaces will work
Drop dispose from Reporter. Make a Disposable instead. Have FileReporter implement Disposable, and I think the GUI one too, whichever ones needed it. Anyone that was calling dispose(), needs to do a pattern match for Disposable now first.
Try sorting the GUI reports with the ordinal
Add durations to the places that take them
Change the name of groups to tags everywhere, can deprecate groups for two releases
add the 'it should/must ""/describe a ""/describe it ""' style to Spec

make tag annotations on Suite require extension of TagAnnotation

add pending functionality to Suite

add a pending singleton or val to Suite

put info in FunSuite in Atomic

add info functionality to Spec

try the GivenWhenThen trait, to see if indented text works

ask folks about the beforeAll and afterAll in BeforeAndAfter

make ShouldBehaveLike and MustBehaveLike traits

Do the OneInstancePerTest and ConcurrentTestExecution traits

Do the OneArgXXX traits

Do a trait for SequentialNestedSuiteExecution

Do the fixture package for Suite, FunSuite, and Spec

Make a Goodies trait for getting the Goodies into a test

Add the things for Property based testing displaying args nicely in the GUI (like empty strings should be "")

The eating error message problem. Make sure an exception message shows up in the GUI/Print output.

I think WordSpec and FeatureSpec can be 0.9.7.

Oh, and must fix the problem of counting tests when using config params.

I'm not printing out the message in a formatted report, just the exception's detail message

Drop ExecuteAndRun if it can indeed be done away with after getting ShouldBehaveLike in place.
