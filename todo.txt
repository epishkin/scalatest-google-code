Use filter in the run methods

Try sorting the GUI reports with the ordinal

Refactor SuiteRerunner to just create a tools.SuiteRunner and call run on that. Maybe SuiteRunner should be in org.scalatest, because
it is also used by Distributor and will be used by SuiteRerunner.

ask folks about run versus execute
ask folks about TestCase/Suite compatibility (check about testNames, because if that doesn't work it really is a non-starter)

do I put Ordinal in the scalatest package, or what?

Complete JUnitSuite, JUnitRunner GEORGE?
Do JUnitWrapperSuite and the command line param GEORGE?
Create a command line param that takes regular "classpath" style runpath, so path names with spaces will work GEORGE?

Add durations to the places that take them GEORGE?

add the 'it should/must ""/describe a ""/describe it ""' style to Spec

add pending functionality to Suite

add a pending singleton or val to Suite (support both (pending) and { *** pending *** } styles

Change info in FunSuite to probably use an actor so multiple threads can fire infos. Oh and maybe you need to put the var that holds the current one in an atomic. Because only one thread should be writing to that.

add info functionality to Spec. Try the GivenWhenThen trait, to see if indented text works. Support both when("...") and --- when "..." styles.

maybe move Ordinal up to the org.scalatest package? Because it shows up in those signatures and it is a pain, actualy it doesn't sho
up in those signatures anymore, I don't think, because Tracker does.

ask folks about the beforeAll and afterAll in BeforeAndAfter

make ShouldBehaveLike and MustBehaveLike traits
Drop ExecuteAndRun if it can indeed be done away with after getting ShouldBehaveLike in place.

Do the OneInstancePerTest and ConcurrentTestExecution traits

Do the OneArgXXX traits

Do a trait for SequentialNestedSuiteExecution

Do the fixture package for Suite, FunSuite, and Spec

Make a GoodiesFixture trait for getting the goodies into a test

Add the things for Property based testing displaying args nicely in the GUI (like empty strings should be "")

The eating error message problem. Make sure an exception message shows up in the GUI/Print output.

Do WordSpec and FeatureSpec. WordSpec can use the same data structure as Spec, which would then give it the same kind of output.

Oh, and must fix the problem of counting tests when using config params. RunStopped, RunCompleted, and RunAborted all take an optional Summary. When fired from Runner, SuiteRerunner, and TestRerunner, these are Nones. So maybe I enhance DispatchReporter to count these? To reset the count to zero when a RunCompleted, RunStopped, or RunAborted comes through? It would be counted by the actor thread. And if the summary field was a None, it would replace it with a Some that has these counts in it.

Print out the summary info, once it is getting sent.

I'm not printing out the message in a formatted report, just the exception's detail message

Add more overloaded methods to Informer that take optional throwable, formatter, payload, etc.

Do an xml reporter and an html reporter

Put optional colors on standard output or maybe PrintReporter ones.

Add testsFor to FunSuite. Use same data structure as Spec. Otherwise SharedTests would be a pain. In FeatureSpec,
will have scenariosFor. Could limit the nesting in FunSuite and FeatureSpec to one level, but seems artificial.

Selfless traitify PrivateMethodTester
