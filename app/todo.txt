change have key/value to contain key/value DONE?

show actual better in error message for matchers

add a stackDepth location for the likelyLine number, where the error occurred to Report. Add a line showing that probably.

For assertions and matchers, fill in that new Report info. I think it hsould be an OPtion, because tough to do for JUnit/TestNG assertions, etc.

add GivenWhenThen trait

Add FeatureSuite trait. Title goes to constructor? I think I have this more figured out somewhere else. But where?

  As a "bla", I want "bla", So that "bla" plus scenarious

Scenarios are like FuNSuite, but with scenario instead of test. Could use a code gen from FunSuite to Scenarios trait, but I don't
think I'll have a Scenarios trait, just a FeatureSuite one. FeatureSuite will extend GivenWhenThen.

Modify GUI to look nice with Spec Reports.

Use code gen from ShouldMatchers to MustMatchers.
