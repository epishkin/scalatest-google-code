/**
 * Trait that facilitates a style of testing in which each test is run in its own instance
 * of the suite class to isolate each test from the side effects of the other tests in the
 * suite.
 *
 * <p>
 * If you mix this trait into a <code>Suite</code>, you can initialize shared reassignable
 * fixture variables as well as shared mutable fixture objects in the constructor of the
 * class. Because each test will run in its own instance of the class, each test will
 * get a fresh copy of the instance variables. This is the approach to test isolation taken,
 * for example, by the JUnit framework.

  /**
   * Construct a new instance of this <code>Suite</code>.
   *
   * <p>
   * This trait's implementation of <code>runTests</code> invokes this method to create
   * a new instance of this <code>Suite</code> for each test. This trait's implementation
   * of this method uses reflection to call <code>this.getClass.newInstance</code>. This
   * approach will succeed only if this <code>Suite</code>'s class has a public, no-arg
   * constructor. In most cases this is likely to be true, because to be instantiated
   * by ScalaTest's <code>Runner</code> a <code>Suite</code> needs a public, no-arg
   * constructor. However, this will not be true of any <code>Suite</code> defined as
   * an inner class of another class or trait, because every constructor of an inner
   * class type takes a reference to the enclosing instance. In such cases, and in
   * cases where a <code>Suite</code> class is explicitly defined without a public,
   * no-arg constructor, you will need to override this method to construct a new
   * instance of the <code>Suite</code> in some other way.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * Here's an example of how you could override <code>newInstance</code> to construct
   * a new instance of an inner class:
   * </p>
   *
   * <pre>
   * import org.scalatest.Suite
   *
   * class Outer {
   *   class InnerSuite extends Suite with OneInstancePerTest {
   *     def testOne() {}
   *     def testTwo() {}
   *     override def newInstance = new InnerSuite
   *   }
   * }
