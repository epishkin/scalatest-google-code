/**
 * Trait that abstracts out the <code>execute</code> and <code>runTest</code> methods of <code>Suite</code>. This
 * trait exists to support the use of trait <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>, which is a direct subtrait of this trait. The
 * <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> trait's implementation of <code>runTest</code> surrounds an invocation of
 * <code>super.runTest</code> in calls to <code>beforeEach</code> and <code>afterEach</code>. Similarly, the
 * <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> trait's implementation of <code>execute</code> surrounds an invocation of
 * <code>super.execute</code> in calls to <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code>. This enables trait
 * <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> to be mixed into any <code>Suite</code>, but not into a trait that contains shared examples
 * for a <code>Spec<code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The main purpose of <code>ExecuteAndRun</code> is to render a compiler error the mistake of attempting
 * to mix <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> into a trait containing shared examples for a <code>Spec</code>. If <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> extended
 * </code>Suite</code> itself, then it would compile if mixed into such a trait, but wouldn't work
 * as expected (i.e., the <code>beforeEach</code> and <code>afterEach</code> methods would never be called).
 * This goal can't be achieved by making the self type of <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> <code>Suite</code>, because
 * in that case <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> couldn't wrap calls to the mixed into <code>Suite</code>,
 * given <code>Suite</code> would not be <code>super</code>, and calling <code>execute</code> on <code>this</code>
 * would result in infinite recursion.
