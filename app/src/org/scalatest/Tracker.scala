/**
 * Instances of this class are not thread safe. It should be used by only one thread. Anytime a new
 * thread will be involved in sending events, a new Tracker should be obtained by invoking <code>nextTracker()</code>.
 * 
 * The reason Tracker is not immutable is that methods would have to pass back, and that's hard because exceptions can
 * also be thrown. So this mutable object is how methods invoked "returns" updates to the current ordinal whether those
 * methods return normally or complete abruptly with an exception. Also, sometimes with closures capturing free variables,
 * those free variables may want to grab an ordinal in the context of a callee even after the callee has already called
 * some other method. So in other words the calling method may need to know the "current ordinal" even before the method
 * it calls has completed in any manner, i.e., while it is running. (The example is the info stuff in FunSuite, which sets
 * up an info that's useful during a run, then calls super.run(...).
