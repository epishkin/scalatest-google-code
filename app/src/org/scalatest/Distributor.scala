/**
 * <p>
 * A object that facilitates concurrent and/or distributed execution of <code>Suite</code>s.
 * An optional <code>Distributor</code> is passed to the <code>execute</code> method of <code>Suite</code>. If a
 * <code>Distributor</code> is indeed passed, trait <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of <code>execute</code> will
 * populate that <code>Distributor</code> with its nested <code>Suite</code>s (by passing them to the <code>Distributor</code>'s
 * <code>put</code> method) rather than executing the nested <code>Suite</code>s directly. It is then up to another party or parties
 * to execute those <code>Suite</code>s.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you have a set of nested <code>Suite</code>s that must be executed sequentially, you can override <code>runNestedSuites</code> and
 * call this trait's implementation, passing in <code>None</code> for the <code>Distributor</code>. For example:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * override protected def runNestedSuites(reporter: Reporter, stopper: Stopper,
 *     includes: Set[String], excludes: Set[String], properties: Map[String, Any],
 *     distributor: Option[Distributor]) {
 *
 *   // Execute nested suites sequentially
 *   super.runNestedSuites(reporter, stopper, includes, excludes, properties, None)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this trait must be thread safe.
 * </p>
