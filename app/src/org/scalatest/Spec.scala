/**
 * Trait that facilitates a &#8220;behavior-driven&#8221; style of development (BDD), in which tests
 * are combined with text that specifies the behavior the tests verify.
 * Here's an example <code>Spec</code>:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 *
 * class StackSpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   describe("A Stack") {
 *
 *     it("should pop values in last-in-first-out order") {
 *       val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *       stack.push(1)
 *       stack.push(2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 1)
 *     }
 *
 *     it("should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped") {
 *       val emptyStack = new Stack[String]
 *       intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
 *         emptyStack.pop()
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>Spec</code> contains <em>describers</em> and <em>examples</em>. You define a describer
 * with <code>describe</code>, and a example with <code>it</code>. Both
 * <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> are methods, defined in
 * <code>Spec</code>, which will be invoked
 * by the primary constructor of <code>StackSpec</code>. 
 * A describer names, or gives more information about, the <em>subject</em> (class or other entity) you are specifying
 * and testing. In the above example, "A Stack"
 * is the subject under specification and test. With each example you provide a string (the <em>spec text</em>) that specifies
 * one bit of behavior of the subject, and a block of code that tests that behavior.
 * You place the spec text between the parentheses, followed by the test code between curly
 * braces.  The test code will be wrapped up as a function passed as a by-name parameter to
 * <code>it</code>, which will register the test for later execution.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When you execute a <code>Spec</code>, it will send <code>SpecReport</code>s to the
 * <code>Reporter</code>. ScalaTest's built-in reporters will report these <code>SpecReports</code> in such a way
 * that the output is easy to read as an informal specification of the entity under test.
 * For example, if you ran <code>StackSpec</code> from within the Scala interpreter:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scala> (new StackSpec).execute()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You would see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * A Stack
 * - should pop values in last-in-first-out order
 * - should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Test fixtures</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A test <em>fixture</em> is objects or other artifacts (such as files, sockets, database
 * connections, etc.) used by tests to do their work. You can use fixtures in
 * <code>Spec</code>s with the same approaches suggested for <code>Suite</code> in
 * its documentation. The same text that appears in the test fixture
 * section of <code>Suite</code>'s documentation is repeated here, with examples changed from
 * <code>Suite</code> to <code>Spec</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a fixture is used by only one test, then the definitions of the fixture objects should
 * be local to the test function, such as the objects assigned to <code>stack</code> and <code>emptyStack</code> in the
 * previous <code>StackSpec</code> examples. If multiple tests need to share a fixture, the best approach
 * is to assign them to instance variables. Here's a (very contrived) example, in which the object assigned
 * to <code>shared</code> is used by multiple test functions:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 *
 * class ArithmeticSpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   // Sharing fixture objects via instance variables
 *   val shared = 5
 *
 *   it("should add correctly") {
 *     val sum = 2 + 3
 *     assert(sum === shared)
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should subtract correctly") {
 *     val diff = 7 - 2
 *     assert(diff === shared)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In some cases, however, shared <em>mutable</em> fixture objects may be changed by test methods such that
 * it needs to be recreated or reinitialized before each test. Shared resources such
 * as files or database connections may also need to 
 * be cleaned up after each test. JUnit offers methods <code>setup</code> and
 * <code>tearDown</code> for this purpose. In ScalaTest, you can use the <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> trait,
 * which will be described later, to implement an approach similar to JUnit's <code>setup</code>
 * and <code>tearDown</code>, however, this approach often involves reassigning <code>var</code>s
 * between tests. Before going that route, you should consider two approaches that
 * avoid <code>var</code>s. One approach is to write one or more "create" methods
 * that return a new instance of a needed object (or a tuple of new instances of
 * multiple objects) each time it is called. You can then call a create method at the beginning of each
 * test that needs the fixture, storing the fixture object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class MySpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   // create objects needed by tests and return as a tuple
 *   def createFixture = (
 *     new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is "),
 *     new ListBuffer[String]
 *   )
 *
 *   it("should mutate shared fixture objects") {
 *     val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *     lbuf += "sweet"
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should get a fresh set of mutable fixture objects") {
 *     val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another approach to mutable fixture objects that avoids <code>var</code>s is to create "with" methods,
 * which take test code as a function that takes the fixture objects as parameters, and wrap test code in calls to the "with" method. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class MySpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   def withFixture(testFunction: (StringBuilder, ListBuffer[String]) => Unit) {
 *
 *     // Create needed mutable objects
 *     val sb = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *     val lb = new ListBuffer[String]
 *
 *     // Invoke the test function, passing in the mutable objects
 *     testFunction(sb, lb)
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should mutate shared fixture objects") {
 *     withFixture {
 *       (builder, lbuf) => {
 *         builder.append("easy!")
 *         assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *         assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *         lbuf += "sweet"
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should get a fresh set of mutable fixture objects") {
 *     withFixture {
 *       (builder, lbuf) => {
 *         builder.append("fun!")
 *         assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *         assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * One advantage of this approach compared to the create method approach shown previously is that
 * you can more easily perform cleanup after each test executes. For example, you
 * could create a temporary file before each test, and delete it afterwords, by
 * doing so before and after invoking the test function in a <code>withTempFile</code>
 * method. Here's an example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 * 
 * class MySpec extends Spec {
 * 
 *   def withTempFile(testFunction: FileReader => Unit) {
 * 
 *     val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *  
 *     // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *  
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     val reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *  
 *     try {
 *       // Run the test using the temp file
 *       testFunction(reader)
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       // Close and delete the temp file
 *       reader.close()
 *       val file = new File(FileName)
 *       file.delete()
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   it("should read from a temp file") {
 *     withTempFile {
 *       (reader) => {
 *         var builder = new StringBuilder
 *         var c = reader.read()
 *         while (c != -1) {
 *           builder.append(c.toChar)
 *           c = reader.read()
 *         }
 *         assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   it("should read the first char of a temp file") {
 *     withTempFile {
 *       (reader) => {
 *         assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you are more comfortable with reassigning instance variables, however, you can
 * instead use the <code>BeforeAndafter</code> trait, which provides
 * methods that will be run before and after each test. <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>'s
 * <code>beforeEach</code> method will be run before, and its <code>afterEach</code>
 * method after, each test (like JUnit's <code>setup</code>  and <code>tearDown</code>
 * methods, respectively). For example, here's how you'd write the previous
 * test that uses a temp file with <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfter
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 *
 * class MySpec extends Spec with BeforeAndAfter {
 *
 *   private val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *   private var reader: FileReader = _
 *
 *   // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *   override def beforeEach() {
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *   }
 *
 *   // Close and delete the temp file
 *   override def afterEach() {
 *     reader.close()
 *     val file = new File(FileName)
 *     file.delete()
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should read from a temp file") {
 *     var builder = new StringBuilder
 *     var c = reader.read()
 *     while (c != -1) {
 *       builder.append(c.toChar)
 *       c = reader.read()
 *     }
 *     assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should read the first char of a temp file") {
 *     assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example, the instance variable <code>reader</code> is a <code>var</code>, so
 * it can be reinitialized between tests by the <code>beforeEach</code> method. If you
 * want to execute code before and after all tests (and nested suites) in a suite, such
 * as you could do with <code>@BeforeClass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code>
 * annotations in JUnit 4, you can use the <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code>
 * methods of <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>. See the documentation for <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> for
 * an example.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Test groups</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>Spec</code>'s tests may be classified into named <em>groups</em>.
 * As with any suite, when executing a <code>Spec</code>, groups of tests can
 * optionally be included and/or excluded. To place <code>Spec</code> tests into
 * groups, you pass objects that extend abstract class <code>org.scalatest.Group</code> to the methods
 * that register tests, <code>it</code> and <code>ignore</code>. Class <code>Group</code> takes one parameter,
 * a string name.  If you have
 * created Java annotation interfaces for use as group names in direct subclasses of <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>,
 * then you will probably want to use group names on your <code>Spec</code>s that match. To do so, simply 
 * pass the fully qualified names of the Java interfaces to the <code>Group</code> constructor. For example, if you've
 * defined Java annotation interfaces with fully qualified names, <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> and <code>com.mycompany.groups.DBTest</code>, then you could
 * create matching groups for <code>Spec</code>s like this:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Group
 *
 * object SlowTest extends Group("com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest")
 * object DBTest extends Group("com.mycompany.groups.DBTest")
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Given these definitions, you could place <code>Spec</code> tests into groups like this:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 *
 * class MySuite extends Spec {
 *
 *   it("should add correctly", SlowTest) {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should subtract correctly", SlowTest, DBTest) {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *     assert(diff - 2 === 1)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This code places both tests into the <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> group, 
 * and test <code>"should subtract correctly"</code> into the <code>com.mycompany.groups.DBTest</code> group.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The primary execute method takes two <code>Set[String]</code>s called <code>includes</code> and
 * <code>excludes</code>. If <code>includes</code> is empty, all tests will be executed
 * except those those belonging to groups listed in the
 * <code>excludes</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>includes</code> is non-empty, only tests
 * belonging to groups mentioned in <code>includes</code>, and not mentioned in <code>excludes</code>,
 * will be executed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Ignored tests</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support the common use case of &#8220;temporarily&#8221; disabling a test, with the
 * good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>Spec</code> provides registration
 * methods that start with <code>ignore</code> instead of <code>it</code>. For example, to temporarily
 * disable the test with the name <code>"should pop values in last-in-first-out order"</code>, just change &#8220;<code>it</code>&#8221; into &#8220;<code>ignore</code>,&#8221; like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 *
 * class StackSpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   describe("A Stack") {
 *
 *     ignore("should pop values in last-in-first-out order") {
 *       val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *       stack.push(1)
 *       stack.push(2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 1)
 *     }
 *
 *     it("should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped") {
 *       val emptyStack = new Stack[String]
 *       intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
 *         emptyStack.pop()
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this version of <code>StackSpec</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scala> (new StackSpec).execute()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run only the second test and report that the first test was ignored:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * A Stack
 * - should pop values in last-in-first-out order !!! IGNORED !!!
 * - should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * As with <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>, the ignore feature is implemented as a group. The
 * <code>execute</code> method that takes no parameters
 * adds <code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> to the <code>excludes</code> <code>Set</code> it passes to
 * the primary <code>execute</code> method, as does <code>Runner</code>. The only difference between
 * <code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> and the groups you may define and exclude is that ScalaTest reports
 * ignored tests to the <code>Reporter</code>. The reason ScalaTest reports ignored tests is as a feeble
 * attempt to encourage ignored tests to be eventually fixed and added back into the active suite of tests.
 * </p>

   * If <code>includes</code> is empty, all tests will be executed

   * For each test in the <code>testName</code> <code>Set</code>, in the order
   * they appear in the iterator obtained by invoking the <code>elements</code> method on the <code>Set</code>, this trait's implementation
   * of this method checks whether the test should be run based on the <code>includes</code> and <code>excludes</code> <code>Set</code>s.
   * If so, this implementation invokes <code>runTest</code>, passing in:
   * </p>

   * <li><code>goodies</code> - the <code>goodies</code> <code>Map</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li>

   * @param testName an optional name of one test to execute. If <code>None</code>, all relevant tests should be executed.
   *                 I.e., <code>None</code> acts like a wildcard that means execute all relevant tests in this <code>Spec</code>.
   * @param reporter the <code>Reporter</code> to which results will be reported
   * @param stopper the <code>Stopper</code> that will be consulted to determine whether to stop execution early.
   * @param includes a <code>Set</code> of <code>String</code> test names to include in the execution of this <code>Spec</code>
