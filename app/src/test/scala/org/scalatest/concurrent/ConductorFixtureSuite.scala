  // One issue is whther ConductorMethods should have a conduct on it at all. Possibly not, but the trouble
  // is then that Conductor does have this method, and ConductorMethods wouldn't be being completely honest.
  // Also there would be something you could call in ConductorFixture that you couldn't call in ConductorMethods.
  // So my feeling is go ahead and add it to be consistent, but I'm not sure. Please check also to see if there are any
  // other public methods on Conductor that are not in ConductorMethods. If this is the only one, then probably we
  // should add it.

  // TODO: i dont think we should expose conduct on CM's. it just doesn't make sense.
  // even if it is the only method that isn't exposed (still need to check) if it simply doesnt
  // make sense to the api, and causes problems, then why add it?
