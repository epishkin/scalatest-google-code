/**
 * A suite of tests that can be run with either TestNG or ScalaTest. This trait allows you to mark any
 * method as a test using TestNG's <code>@Test</code> annotation, and supports all other TestNG annotations.
 * Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.testng.TestNGSuite
 * import org.testng.annotations.Test
 * import org.testng.annotations.Configuration
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class MySuite extends TestNGSuite {
 * 
 *   var sb: StringBuilder = _
 *   var lb: ListBuffer[String] = _
 * 
 *   @Configuration { val beforeTestMethod = true }
 *   def setUpFixture() {
 *     sb = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *     lb = new ListBuffer[String]
 *   }
 * 
 *   @Test { val invocationCount = 3 }
 *   def easyTest() {
 *     sb.append("easy!")
 *     assert(sb.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(lb.isEmpty)
 *     lb += "sweet"
 *   }
 * 
 *   @Test { val groups = Array("com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest") }
 *   def funTest() {
 *     sb.append("fun!")
 *     assert(sb.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(lb.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * To execute <code>TestNGSuite</code>s with ScalaTest's <code>Runner</code>, you must include TestNG's jar file on the class path or runpath.
 * This version of <code>TestNGSuite</code> was tested with TestNG version 5.7.
 * </p>

   *                not support the notion of aborting a run early, this class ignores this parameter.
   * @param   properties         a <code>Map</code> of properties that can be used by the executing <code>Suite</code> of tests. This class
   *                      does not use this parameter.

   *              by another entity, such as concurrently by a pool of threads. If <code>None</code>, nested <code>Suite</code>s will be executed sequentially.
   *              Because TestNG handles its own concurrency, this class ignores this parameter.
