/**
 * A suite of tests that can be run with either JUnit 3 or ScalaTest. This trait allows you to write JUnit 3 tests
 * with ScalaTest's more concise assertion syntax as well as JUnit's assertions (<code>assertEquals</code>, etc.).
 * You create tests by defining methods that start with <code>test</code>, and can create fixtures with methods
 * named <code>setUp</code> and <code>tearDown</code>. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.junit.JUnit3Suite
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class TwoSuite extends JUnit3Suite {
 *
 *   var sb: StringBuilder = _
 *   var lb: ListBuffer[String] = _
 *
 *   override def setUp() {
 *     sb = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *     lb = new ListBuffer[String]
 *   }
 *
 *   def testEasy() {
 *     sb.append("easy!")
 *     assert(sb.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(lb.isEmpty)
 *     lb += "sweet"
 *   }
 *
 *   def testFun() {
 *     sb.append("fun!")
 *     assert(sb.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(lb.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To execute <code>JUnit3Suite</code>s with ScalaTest's <code>Runner</code>, you must include JUnit3's jar file on the class path or runpath.
 * This version of <code>JUnit3Suite</code> was tested with JUnit version 3.8.1.
 * </p>
