/**
 * <strong>Note: <code>JUnit3Suite</code> has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future version of ScalaTest. Please
 * change to using <code>JUnitComforSuite</code> instead. <code>JUnitComfortSuite</code> does not extend <code>junit.framework.TestCase</code>. In versions 
 * of ScalaTest prior to 0.9.5, <code>JUnit3Suite</code> extended <code>TestCase</code> so that it could be run by a JUnit 3 runner. In
 * 0.9.6, ScalaTest's <code>execute</code> methods were renamed to <code>run</code>, which is not compatible with <code>TestCase</code>.
 * As a result the goal of providing a trait in ScalaTest that can either run with ScalaTest and JUnit 3 was dropped. Instead, the
 * <code>JUnitComfortSuite</code> trait can give you that comfortable feeling of using JUnit 3-like syntax, and it can be run with
 * either ScalaTest or JUnit 4.</strong>
