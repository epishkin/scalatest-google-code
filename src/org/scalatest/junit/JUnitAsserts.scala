/**
 * Trait that provides convenient access to the JUnit's assertion methods. You need not
 * include JUnit's JAR file on the class or run path to execute suites mixing in this trait.
 * For example, you could use JUnit assertions in a <code>Suite</code> like this:
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Suite
 * import org.scalatest.junit.JUnitAsserts
 *
 * class MySuite extends Suite with JUnitAsserts {
 *
 *   def testAddition() {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assertEquals(2, sum)
 *     assertEquals(4, sum + 2)
 *   }
 *
 *   def testSubtraction() {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assertEquals(3, diff)
 *     assertEquals(1, diff - 2)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
