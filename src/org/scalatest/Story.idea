Story: transfer from savings to checking account
  As a savings account holder
  I want to transfer money from my savings account to my checking account
  So that I can get cash easily from an ATM

  Scenario: savings account has sufficient funds
    Given my savings account balance is s, where s >= 0
    And my checking account balance is c, where c >= 0
    When I transfer t, where t >= 0 and t <= s, from savings to checking
    Then my savings account balance should be s - t
    And my checking account balance should be c + t

  Scenario: savings account has insufficient funds
    Given my savings account balance is s, where s >= 0
    And my checking account balance is c, where c >= 0
    When I transfer t, where t >= 0 and t > s, from savings to checking
    Then my savings account balance should be s
    And my checking account balance should be c

Then from that we can write properties

So a Story and a PropStory.

Could just require people to do with methods or create methods.

  scenario("savings account has insufficient funds") {
    withSavingsAndChecking {
      (savings, checking) => {
        given("my savings account balance is $50")
        and("my checking account balance is $10")
        when("I transfer $60 from savings to checking")
        then("my savings account balance should be $50")
        and("my checking account balance should be $10")
      }
    }
  }

or

  scenario("savings account has insufficient funds") {
    val (savings, checking) = createSavingsAndChecking
    given("my savings account balance is $50")
    and("my checking account balance is $10")
    when("I transfer $60 from savings to checking")
    then("my savings account balance should be $50")
    and("my checking account balance should be $10")
  }

Then not give them an ImpStory and ImpSpec unless they scream.
