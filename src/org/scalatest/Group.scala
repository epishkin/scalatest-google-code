/**
 * Abstract class whose subclasses can be as to <code>FunSuite</code> test
 * registration methods to place tests into groups. For example, if you define:
 * <pre>
 * object SlowTest extends Group("SlowTest")
 * </pre>
 *
 * then you can place a test into the <code>SlowTest</code> group like this:
 * <pre>
 * class MySuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   test("my test", SlowTest) {
 *     Thread.sleep(1000)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If you have created Java annotation interfaces for use as group names in direct subclasses of <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>,
 * then you will probably want to use group names on your <code>FunSuite</code>s that match. To do so, simply 
 * pass the fully qualified names of the Java interfaces to the <code>Group</code> constructor. For example, if you've
 * defined a Java annotation interface with fully qualified name, <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code>, then you could
 * create a matching group for <code>FunSuite</code>s like this:
 * <pre>
 * object SlowTest extends Group("com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest")
 * </pre>
