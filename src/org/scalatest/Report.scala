 * Class used to send reports to a <code>Reporter</code>.

 * message, optional throwable, optional rerunnable, thread name, and date. This class can be subclassed to send more information
 * to a reporter.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param name the name of the entity about which this report was generated.
 * @param message a <code>String</code> message.
 * @param throwable the <code>Throwable</code> that indicated the problem, or a <code>Throwable</code> created
 *     to capture stack trace information about the problem, or <code>None</code>. If <code>None</code> is passed, the problem
 *     is reported without describing a <code>Throwable</code>.
 * @param rerunnable a <code>Rerunnable</code> that can be used to rerun a test or other entity (such as a suite),
 *     or <code>None</code>. If <code>None</code> is passed, the test or other entity can not be rerun.
 * @param threadName a name for the <code>Thread</code> about whose activity this report was generated.
 * @param date a relevant <code>Date</code>. For example, the a <code>Date</code>
 *     indicating the time this <code>Report</code> was generated, or a <code>Date</code>
 *      indicating the time the event reported by this <code>Report</code> occurred.
 *
 * @throws NullPointerException if any of the specified
 *     <code>name</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>throwable</code>, or <code>rerunnable</code>, <code>threadName</code>, or
 *     <code>date</code> references are <code>null</code>.

 * <code>Report</code> can be subclassed so that custom information can be passed to the subclass's constructor.
 * This information can be passed in when the <code>Report</code> subclass is instantiated, from within
 * test methods, overridden <code>Suite</code> methods, or other code. Instances of <code>Report</code> subclasses
 * can be passed to any <code>Reporter</code>, but any custom information they contain will not be presented to the
 * user except by <code>Reporter</code>s written with knowledge of the <code>Report</code> subclass and its custom
 * information. Thus, when you define a <code>Report</code> subclass that embeds custom information, you would typically
 * also define one or more <code>Reporter</code> classes that present the custom information to the user.

/*
This was an interesting excercise to decide whether to provide overloaded constructors
for say:

1. String, String, Option[Throwable]

2. String, String, Throwable, Rerunnable

3. String String, Throwable

4. String, String, Rerunable

Decided to make people say None at the end, so no 1. Decided it was confusing to have throwable be
both an Option[Throwable] and a Throwable. So didn't do the others. Maybe convenient, but confusing
and i realized sometimes I had an Option[Rerunnable] variable already, so I really did want to pass
that in without checking it with a match. (for a while I thought I would only have 2, 3, and 4.)
