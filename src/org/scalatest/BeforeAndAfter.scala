/**
 * Trait that can be mixed into suites that need methods invoked before and after executing the
 * suite, and/or before and after running each test. This trait facilitates a style of testing in which mutable
 * fixture objects held in instance variables are replaced or reinitialized before each test or
 * suite. Here's an example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest._
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class MySuite extends BeforeAndAfter {
 *
 *   // Fixtures as reassignable variables and mutable objects
 *   var sb: StringBuilder = _
 *   val lb = new ListBuffer[String]
 * 
 *   override def beforeEach() {
 *     sb = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *     lb.clear()
 *   }
 *
 *   def testEasy() {
 *     sb.append("easy!")
 *     assert(sb.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(lb.isEmpty)
 *     lb += "sweet"
 *   }
 *
 *   def testFun() {
 *     sb.append("fun!")
 *     assert(sb.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(lb.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Because this trait invokes <code>super.run</code> to run the suite and <code>super.runTest</code> to
 * run each test, you may need to mix this trait in last to get the desired behavior. For example, this won't
 * work, because <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> is "super" to </code>FunSuite</code>:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * class MySuite extends BeforeAndAfter with FunSuite 
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You'd need to turn it around, so that <code>FunSuite</code> is "super" to <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * class MySuite extends FunSuite with BeforeAndAfter
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you want to do something before and after both the tests and the nested <code>Suite</code>s,
 * then you can override <code>run</code> itself, or use the <code>beforeAll</code>
 * and <code>afterAll</code> methods of <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>.
 * </p>
