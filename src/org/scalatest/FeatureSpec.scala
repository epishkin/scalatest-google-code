/**
 * A suite of tests in which each test represents one <em>scenario</em> of a <em>feature</em>. 
 * <code>FeatureSpec</code> is intended for writing tests that are "higher level" than unit tests, for example, integration
 * tests, functional tests, and acceptance tests. You can use <code>FeatureSpec</code> for unit testing if you prefer, however.
 * Here's an example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * import org.scalatest.GivenWhenThen
 * import scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 * 
 * class StackFeatureSpec extends FeatureSpec with GivenWhenThen {
 * 
 *   feature("The user can pop an element off the top of the stack") {
 * 
 *     info("As a programmer")
 *     info("I want to be able to pop items off the stack")
 *     info("So that I can get them in last-in-first-out order")
 * 
 *     scenario("pop is invoked on a non-empty stack") {
 * 
 *       given("a non-empty stack")
 *       val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *       stack.push(1)
 *       stack.push(2)
 *       val oldSize = stack.size
 * 
 *       when("when pop is invoked on the stack")
 *       val result = stack.pop()
 * 
 *       then("the most recently pushed element should be returned")
 *       assert(result === 2)
 * 
 *       and("the stack should have one less item than before")
 *       assert(stack.size === oldSize - 1)
 *     }
 * 
 *     scenario("pop is invoked on an empty stack") {
 * 
 *       given("an empty stack")
 *       val emptyStack = new Stack[String]
 * 
 *       when("when pop is invoked on the stack")
 *       then("NoSuchElementException should be thrown")
 *       intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
 *         emptyStack.pop()
 *       }
 * 
 *       and("the stack should still be empty")
 *       assert(emptyStack.isEmpty)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FeatureSpec</code> contains <em>feature clauses</em> and <em>scenarios</em>. You define a feature clause
 * with <code>feature</code>, and a scenario with <code>scenario</code>. Both
 * <code>feature</code> and <code>scenario</code> are methods, defined in
 * <code>FeatureSpec</code>, which will be invoked
 * by the primary constructor of <code>StackFeatureSpec</code>. 
 * A feature clause describes a feature of the <em>subject</em> (class or other entity) you are specifying
 * and testing. In the previous example, 
 * the subject under specification and test is a stack. The feature being specified and tested is 
 * the ability for a user (a programmer in this case) to pop an element off the top of the stack. With each scenario you provide a
 * string (the <em>spec text</em>) that specifies the behavior of the subject for
 * one scenario in which the feature may be used, and a block of code that tests that behavior.
 * You place the spec text between the parentheses, followed by the test code between curly
 * braces.  The test code will be wrapped up as a function passed as a by-name parameter to
 * <code>scenario</code>, which will register the test for later execution.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s lifecycle has two phases: the <em>registration</em> phase and the
 * <em>ready</em> phase. It starts in registration phase and enters ready phase the first time
 * <code>run</code> is called on it. It then remains in ready phase for the remainder of its lifetime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Scenarios can only be registered with the <code>scenario</code> method while the <code>FeatureSpec</code> is
 * in its registration phase. Any attempt to register a scenario after the <code>FeatureSpec</code> has
 * entered its ready phase, <em>i.e.</em>, after <code>run</code> has been invoked on the <code>FeatureSpec</code>,
 * will be met with a thrown <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>. The recommended style
 * of using <code>FeatureSpec</code> is to register tests during object construction as is done in all
 * the examples shown here. If you keep to the recommended style, you should never see a
 * <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each scenario represents one test. The name of the test is the spec text passed to the <code>scenario</code> method.
 * The feature name does not appear as part of the test name. In a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, therefore, you must take care
 * to ensure that each test has a unique name (in other words, that each <code>scenario</code> has unique spec text).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When you run a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, it will send <code>Formatter</code>s in the events it sends to the
 * <code>Reporter</code>. ScalaTest's built-in reporters will report these events in such a way
 * that the output is easy to read as an informal specification of the <em>subject</em> being tested.
 * For example, if you ran <code>StackFeatureSpec</code> from within the Scala interpreter:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scala> (new StackFeatureSpec).run()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You would see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Feature: The user can pop an element off the top of the stack 
 *   As a programmer 
 *   I want to be able to pop items off the stack 
 *   So that I can get them in last-in-first-out order 
 *   Scenario: pop is invoked on a non-empty stack
 *     Given a non-empty stack 
 *     When when pop is invoked on the stack 
 *     Then the most recently pushed element should be returned 
 *     And the stack should have one less item than before 
 *   Scenario: pop is invoked on an empty stack
 *     Given an empty stack 
 *     When when pop is invoked on the stack 
 *     Then NoSuchElementException should be thrown 
 *     And the stack should still be empty 
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Shared fixtures</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A test <em>fixture</em> is objects or other artifacts (such as files, sockets, database
 * connections, etc.) used by tests to do their work. You can use fixtures in
 * <code>FeatureSpec</code>s with the same approaches suggested for <code>Suite</code> in
 * its documentation. The same text that appears in the test fixture
 * section of <code>Suite</code>'s documentation is repeated here, with examples changed from
 * <code>Suite</code> to <code>FeatureSpec</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a fixture is used by only one test, then the definitions of the fixture objects should
 * be local to the test function, such as the objects assigned to <code>stack</code> and <code>emptyStack</code> in the
 * previous <code>StackFeatureSpec</code> examples. If multiple tests need to share a fixture, the best approach
 * is to assign them to instance variables. Here's a (very contrived) example, in which the object assigned
 * to <code>shared</code> is used by multiple test functions:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 *
 * class ArithmeticFeatureSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 *
 *   // Sharing fixture objects via instance variables
 *   val shared = 5
 *
 *   feature("Integer arithmetic") {
 *
 *     scenario("addition") {
 *       val sum = 2 + 3
 *       assert(sum === shared)
 *     }
 *
 *     scenario("subtraction") {
 *       val diff = 7 - 2
 *       assert(diff === shared)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In some cases, however, shared <em>mutable</em> fixture objects may be changed by test methods such that
 * it needs to be recreated or reinitialized before each test. Shared resources such
 * as files or database connections may also need to 
 * be cleaned up after each test. JUnit offers methods <code>setUp</code> and
 * <code>tearDown</code> for this purpose. In ScalaTest, you can use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait,
 * which will be described later, to implement an approach similar to JUnit's <code>setUp</code>
 * and <code>tearDown</code>, however, this approach often involves reassigning <code>var</code>s
 * between tests. Before going that route, you should consider two approaches that
 * avoid <code>var</code>s. One approach is to write one or more <em>create-fixture</em> methods
 * that return a new instance of a needed object (or a tuple or case class holding new instances of
 * multiple objects) each time it is called. You can then call a create-fixture method at the beginning of each
 * test that needs the fixture, storing the fixture object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class MyFeatureSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 *
 *   // create objects needed by tests and return as a tuple
 *   def createFixture = (
 *     new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is "),
 *     new ListBuffer[String]
 *   )
 *
 *   feature("The create-fixture approach") {
 *
 *     scenario("shared fixture objects are mutated by a test") {
 *       val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
 *       builder.append("easy!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *       assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *       lbuf += "sweet"
 *     }
 *
 *     scenario("test gets a fresh copy of the shared fixture") {
 *       val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
 *       builder.append("fun!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *       assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If different tests in the same <code>FeatureSpec</code> require different fixtures, you can create multiple create-fixture methods and
 * call the method (or methods) needed by each test at the begining of the test.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another approach to mutable fixture objects that avoids <code>var</code>s is to create with-fixture methods,
 * which take test code as a function that takes the fixture objects as parameters, and wrap test code in calls to the
 * with-fixture method. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class FileIoFeatureSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 *
 *   def withFixture(testFunction: (StringBuilder, ListBuffer[String]) => Unit) {
 *
 *     // Create needed mutable objects
 *     val sb = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *     val lb = new ListBuffer[String]
 *
 *     // Invoke the test function, passing in the mutable objects
 *     testFunction(sb, lb)
 *   }
 *
 *   feature("The create-fixture approach") {
 *
 *     scenario("shared fixture objects are mutated by a test") {
 *       withFixture { (builder, lbuf) =>
 *         builder.append("easy!")
 *         assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *         assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *         lbuf += "sweet"
 *       }
 *     }
 *  
 *     scenario("test gets a fresh copy of the shared fixture") {
 *       withFixture { (builder, lbuf) =>
 *         builder.append("fun!")
 *         assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *         assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * One advantage of this approach compared to the create-fixture approach shown previously is that
 * you can more easily perform cleanup after each test runs. For example, you
 * could create a temporary file before each test, and delete it afterwords, by
 * doing so before and after invoking the test function in a <code>withTempFile</code>
 * method. Here's an example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 * 
 * class FileIoFeatureSpec extends FeatureSpec {
 * 
 *   def withTempFile(testFunction: FileReader => Unit) {
 * 
 *     val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *  
 *     // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *  
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     val reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *  
 *     try {
 *       // Run the test using the temp file
 *       testFunction(reader)
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       // Close and delete the temp file
 *       reader.close()
 *       val file = new File(FileName)
 *       file.delete()
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   feature("Reading and writing files") {
 *
 *     scenario("reading from a temp file") {
 *       withTempFile { (reader) =>
 *         var builder = new StringBuilder
 *         var c = reader.read()
 *         while (c != -1) {
 *           builder.append(c.toChar)
 *           c = reader.read()
 *         }
 *         assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *       }
 *     }
 * 
 *     scenario("reading first char of a temp file") {
 *       withTempFile { (reader) =>
 *         assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If different tests in the same <code>FeatureSpec</code> require different fixtures, you can create multiple with-fixture methods and
 * call the method (or methods) needed by each test at the beginning of the test. A common case, however, will be that all
 * the tests in a suite need to share the same fixture. To facilitate the with-fixture approach in this common case of a single, shared fixture,
 * ScalaTest provides sister traits in the <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> package that
 * directly support the with-fixture approach. Every test in an <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> trait takes a fixture whose type
 * is defined by the <code>Fixture</code> type. For example, trait <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FeatureSpec</code> behaves exactly like
 * <code>org.scalatest.FeatureSpec</code>, except each test method takes a <code>Fixture</code>. For the details, see the documentation for
 * <a href="fixture/FeatureSpec.html"><code>FeatureSpec</code></a>. To get the idea, however, here's what the previous example would
 * look like rewritten to use an <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FeatureSpec</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureFeatureSpec
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 * 
 * class MySuite extends FixtureFeatureSpec {
 *
 *   type Fixture = FileReader
 *
 *   def withFixture(testFunction: FileReader => Unit) {
 *
 *     val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *
 *     // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     val reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *  
 *     try {
 *       // Run the test using the temp file
 *       testFunction(reader)
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       // Close and delete the temp file
 *       reader.close()
 *       val file = new File(FileName)
 *       file.delete()
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   feature("Reading and writing files") {
 *
 *     scenario("reading from a temp file") { reader =>
 *       var builder = new StringBuilder
 *       var c = reader.read()
 *       while (c != -1) {
 *         builder.append(c.toChar)
 *         c = reader.read()
 *       }
 *       assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *     }
 * 
 *     scenario("reading first char of a temp file") { reader =>
 *       assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you are more comfortable with reassigning instance variables, however, you can
 * instead use the <code>BeforeAndafterEach</code> trait, which provides
 * methods that will be run before and after each test. <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>'s
 * <code>beforeEach</code> method will be run before, and its <code>afterEach</code>
 * method after, each test (like JUnit's <code>setUp</code>  and <code>tearDown</code>
 * methods, respectively). For example, here's how you'd write the previous
 * test that uses a temp file with <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 * import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterEach
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 *
 * class FileIoFeatureSpec extends FeatureSpec with BeforeAndAfterEach {
 *
 *   private val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *   private var reader: FileReader = _
 *
 *   // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *   override def beforeEach() {
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *   }
 *
 *   // Close and delete the temp file
 *   override def afterEach() {
 *     reader.close()
 *     val file = new File(FileName)
 *     file.delete()
 *   }
 *
 *   feature("Reading and writing files") {
 *
 *     scenario("reading from a temp file") {
 *       var builder = new StringBuilder
 *       var c = reader.read()
 *       while (c != -1) {
 *         builder.append(c.toChar)
 *         c = reader.read()
 *       }
 *       assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *
 *     scenario("reading first char of a temp file") {
 *       assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example, the instance variable <code>reader</code> is a <code>var</code>, so
 * it can be reinitialized between tests by the <code>beforeEach</code> method.
 * (It is worth noting that the only difference in the test code between the mutable
 * <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach shown here and the immutable <code>FixtureFeatureSpec</code>
 * approach shown previously is that the <code>FixtureFeatureSpec</code>'s test functions take a <code>FileReader</code> as
 * a parameter via the "<code>reader =></code>" at the beginning of the function. Otherwise the test code is identical.)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you want to execute code before and after all tests (and nested suites) in a suite, such
 * as you could do with <code>@BeforeClass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code>
 * annotations in JUnit 4, you can use the <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code>
 * methods of <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code>. See the documentation for <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> for
 * an example.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Shared tests</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In a <code>FeatureSpec</code>
 * there is no nesting construct analogous to <code>Spec</code>'s <code>describe</code> clause. If the duplicate test name problem shows up in a
 * <code>FeatureSpec</code>, you'll need to pass in a prefix or suffix string to add to each test name. You can pass this string
 * the same way you pass any other data needed by the shared tests, or just call <code>toString</code> on the shared fixture object.
 * Here's an example of how <code>StackBehaviors</code> might look for a <code>FeatureSpec</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * trait StackBehaviors { this: FeatureSpec =>
 * 
 *   def nonEmptyStack(lastItemAdded: Int)(stack: Stack[Int]) {
 * 
 *     test(stack.toString + " should be non-empty") {
 *       assert(!stack.empty)
 *     }  
 * 
 *     test(stack.toString + " should return the top item on peek") {
 *       assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
 *     }
 *   
 *     test(stack.toString + " should not remove the top item on peek") {
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size)
 *     }
 *   
 *     test(stack.toString + " should remove the top item on pop") {
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.pop === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size - 1)
 *     }
 *   }
 *   
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given this <code>StackBahaviors</code> trait, calling it with the <code>stackWithOneItem</code> fixture, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * testsFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * would yield test names:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>Stack(9) should be non-empty</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9) should return the top item on peek</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9) should not remove the top item on peek</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9) should remove the top item on pop</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Whereas calling it with the <code>stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity</code> fixture, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * testsFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity, lastValuePushed))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * would yield different test names:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) should be non-empty</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) should return the top item on peek</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) should not remove the top item on peek</code></li>
 * <li><code>Stack(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) should remove the top item on pop</code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Tagging tests</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names.
 * As with any suite, when executing a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, groups of tests can
 * optionally be included and/or excluded. To tag a <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s tests,
 * you pass objects that extend abstract class <code>org.scalatest.Tag</code> to methods
 * that register tests, <code>test</code> and <code>ignore</code>. Class <code>Tag</code> takes one parameter, a string name.  If you have
 * created Java annotation interfaces for use as group names in direct subclasses of <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>,
 * then you will probably want to use group names on your <code>FeatureSpec</code>s that match. To do so, simply 
 * pass the fully qualified names of the Java interfaces to the <code>Tag</code> constructor. For example, if you've
 * defined Java annotation interfaces with fully qualified names, <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> and
 * <code>com.mycompany.groups.DBTest</code>, then you could
 * create matching groups for <code>FeatureSpec</code>s like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Tag
 *
 * object SlowTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest")
 * object DBTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.groups.DBTest")
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given these definitions, you could place <code>FeatureSpec</code> tests into groups like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 *
 * class MySuite extends FeatureSpec {
 *
 *   test("addition", SlowTest) {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction", SlowTest, DBTest) {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *     assert(diff - 2 === 1)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This code marks both tests, "addition" and "subtraction," with the <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> tag, 
 * and test "subtraction" with the <code>com.mycompany.groups.DBTest</code> tag.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The primary <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
 * <code>Set[String]</code>s called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
 * except those those belonging to tags listed in the
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
 * belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
 * will be run.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Ignored tests</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support the common use case of &#8220;temporarily&#8221; disabling a test, with the
 * good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>FeatureSpec</code> provides registration
 * methods that start with <code>ignore</code> instead of <code>test</code>. For example, to temporarily
 * disable the test named <code>addition</code>, just change &#8220;<code>test</code>&#8221; into &#8220;<code>ignore</code>,&#8221; like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 *
 * class MySuite extends FeatureSpec {
 *
 *   ignore("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction") {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *     assert(diff - 2 === 1)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this version of <code>MySuite</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scala> (new MySuite).run()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run only <code>subtraction</code> and report that <code>addition</code> was ignored:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Test Ignored - MySuite: addition
 * Test Starting - MySuite: subtraction
 * Test Succeeded - MySuite: subtraction
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Pending tests</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
 * pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
 * out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
 * the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
 * what tests and functionality to implement later.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
 * bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
 * sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
 * it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
 * Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
 * sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
 * the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
 * with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
 * the actual test, and possibly the functionality, has not yet been implemented.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although pending tests may be used more often in specification-style suites, such as
 * <code>org.scalatest.Spec</code>, you can also use it in <code>FeatureSpec</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 *
 * class MySuite extends FeatureSpec {
 *
 *   def test("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *   }
 *
 *   def test("subtraction") (pending)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * (Note: "<code>(pending)</code>" is the body of the test. Thus the test contains just one statement, an invocation
 * of the <code>pending</code> method, which throws <code>TestPendingException</code>.)
 * If you run this version of <code>MySuite</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scala> (new MySuite).run()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run both tests, but report that <code>subtraction</code> is pending. You'll see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Test Starting - MySuite: addition
 * Test Succeeded - MySuite: addition
 * Test Starting - MySuite: subtraction
 * Test Pending - MySuite: subtraction
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong>Informers</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * One of the parameters to the primary <code>run</code> method is a <code>Reporter</code>, which
 * will collect and report information about the running suite of tests.
 * Information about suites and tests that were run, whether tests succeeded or failed, 
 * and tests that were ignored will be passed to the <code>Reporter</code> as the suite runs.
 * Most often the reporting done by default by <code>FeatureSpec</code>'s methods will be sufficient, but
 * occasionally you may wish to provide custom information to the <code>Reporter</code> from a test.
 * For this purpose, an <code>Informer</code> that will forward information to the current <code>Reporter</code>
 * is provided via the <code>info</code> parameterless method.
 * You can pass the extra information to the <code>Informer</code> via one of its <code>apply</code> methods.
 * The <code>Informer</code> will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> via an <code>InfoProvided</code> event.
 * Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 *
 * class MySuite extends FeatureSpec {
 *
 *   test("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *     info("Addition seems to work")
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If you run this <code>Suite</code> from the interpreter, you will see the following message
 * included in the printed report:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Test Starting - MySuite: addition
 * Info Provided - MySuite.addition: Addition seems to work
 * Test Succeeded - MySuite: addition
 * </pre>

/*
 * Trait that facilitates a &#8220;behavior-driven&#8221; style of development (BDD), in which tests
 * are combined with text that specifies the behavior the tests verify.
 * Here's an example <code>Spec</code>:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 *
 * class StackSpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   describe("A Stack") {
 *
 *     it("should pop values in last-in-first-out order") {
 *       val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *       stack.push(1)
 *       stack.push(2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 1)
 *     }
 *
 *     it("should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped") {
 *       val emptyStack = new Stack[String]
 *       intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
 *         emptyStack.pop()
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>Spec</code> contains <em>describers</em> and <em>examples</em>. You define a describer
 * with <code>describe</code>, and a example with <code>it</code>. Both
 * <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> are methods, defined in
 * <code>Spec</code>, which will be invoked
 * by the primary constructor of <code>StackSpec</code>. 
 * A describer names, or gives more information about, the <em>subject</em> (class or other entity) you are specifying
 * and testing. In the above example, "A Stack"
 * is the subject under specification and test. With each example you provide a string (the <em>spec text</em>) that specifies
 * one bit of behavior of the subject, and a block of code that tests that behavior.
 * You place the spec text between the parentheses, followed by the test code between curly
 * braces.  The test code will be wrapped up as a function passed as a by-name parameter to
 * <code>it</code>, which will register the test for later execution.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When you execute a <code>Spec</code>, it will send <code>SpecReport</code>s to the
 * <code>Reporter</code>. ScalaTest's built-in reporters will report these <code>SpecReports</code> in such a way
 * that the output is easy to read as an informal specification of the entity under test.
 * For example, if you ran <code>StackSpec</code> from within the Scala interpreter:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scala> (new StackSpec).run()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You would see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * A Stack
 * - should pop values in last-in-first-out order
 * - should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Test fixtures</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A test <em>fixture</em> is objects or other artifacts (such as files, sockets, database
 * connections, etc.) used by tests to do their work. You can use fixtures in
 * <code>Spec</code>s with the same approaches suggested for <code>Suite</code> in
 * its documentation. The same text that appears in the test fixture
 * section of <code>Suite</code>'s documentation is repeated here, with examples changed from
 * <code>Suite</code> to <code>Spec</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a fixture is used by only one test, then the definitions of the fixture objects should
 * be local to the test function, such as the objects assigned to <code>stack</code> and <code>emptyStack</code> in the
 * previous <code>StackSpec</code> examples. If multiple tests need to share a fixture, the best approach
 * is to assign them to instance variables. Here's a (very contrived) example, in which the object assigned
 * to <code>shared</code> is used by multiple test functions:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 *
 * class ArithmeticSpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   // Sharing fixture objects via instance variables
 *   val shared = 5
 *
 *   it("should add correctly") {
 *     val sum = 2 + 3
 *     assert(sum === shared)
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should subtract correctly") {
 *     val diff = 7 - 2
 *     assert(diff === shared)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In some cases, however, shared <em>mutable</em> fixture objects may be changed by test methods such that
 * it needs to be recreated or reinitialized before each test. Shared resources such
 * as files or database connections may also need to 
 * be cleaned up after each test. JUnit offers methods <code>setup</code> and
 * <code>tearDown</code> for this purpose. In ScalaTest, you can use the <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> trait,
 * which will be described later, to implement an approach similar to JUnit's <code>setup</code>
 * and <code>tearDown</code>, however, this approach often involves reassigning <code>var</code>s
 * between tests. Before going that route, you should consider two approaches that
 * avoid <code>var</code>s. One approach is to write one or more "create" methods
 * that return a new instance of a needed object (or a tuple of new instances of
 * multiple objects) each time it is called. You can then call a create method at the beginning of each
 * test that needs the fixture, storing the fixture object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class MySpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   // create objects needed by tests and return as a tuple
 *   def createFixture = (
 *     new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is "),
 *     new ListBuffer[String]
 *   )
 *
 *   it("should mutate shared fixture objects") {
 *     val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *     lbuf += "sweet"
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should get a fresh set of mutable fixture objects") {
 *     val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another approach to mutable fixture objects that avoids <code>var</code>s is to create "with" methods,
 * which take test code as a function that takes the fixture objects as parameters, and wrap test code in calls to the "with" method. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class MySpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   def withFixture(testFunction: (StringBuilder, ListBuffer[String]) => Unit) {
 *
 *     // Create needed mutable objects
 *     val sb = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *     val lb = new ListBuffer[String]
 *
 *     // Invoke the test function, passing in the mutable objects
 *     testFunction(sb, lb)
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should mutate shared fixture objects") {
 *     withFixture {
 *       (builder, lbuf) => {
 *         builder.append("easy!")
 *         assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *         assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *         lbuf += "sweet"
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should get a fresh set of mutable fixture objects") {
 *     withFixture {
 *       (builder, lbuf) => {
 *         builder.append("fun!")
 *         assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *         assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * One advantage of this approach compared to the create method approach shown previously is that
 * you can more easily perform cleanup after each test executes. For example, you
 * could create a temporary file before each test, and delete it afterwords, by
 * doing so before and after invoking the test function in a <code>withTempFile</code>
 * method. Here's an example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 * 
 * class MySpec extends Spec {
 * 
 *   def withTempFile(testFunction: FileReader => Unit) {
 * 
 *     val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *  
 *     // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *  
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     val reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *  
 *     try {
 *       // Run the test using the temp file
 *       testFunction(reader)
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       // Close and delete the temp file
 *       reader.close()
 *       val file = new File(FileName)
 *       file.delete()
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   it("should read from a temp file") {
 *     withTempFile {
 *       (reader) => {
 *         var builder = new StringBuilder
 *         var c = reader.read()
 *         while (c != -1) {
 *           builder.append(c.toChar)
 *           c = reader.read()
 *         }
 *         assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   it("should read the first char of a temp file") {
 *     withTempFile {
 *       (reader) => {
 *         assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you are more comfortable with reassigning instance variables, however, you can
 * instead use the <code>BeforeAndafter</code> trait, which provides
 * methods that will be run before and after each test. <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>'s
 * <code>beforeEach</code> method will be run before, and its <code>afterEach</code>
 * method after, each test (like JUnit's <code>setup</code>  and <code>tearDown</code>
 * methods, respectively). For example, here's how you'd write the previous
 * test that uses a temp file with <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfter
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 *
 * class MySpec extends Spec with BeforeAndAfter {
 *
 *   private val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *   private var reader: FileReader = _
 *
 *   // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *   override def beforeEach() {
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *   }
 *
 *   // Close and delete the temp file
 *   override def afterEach() {
 *     reader.close()
 *     val file = new File(FileName)
 *     file.delete()
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should read from a temp file") {
 *     var builder = new StringBuilder
 *     var c = reader.read()
 *     while (c != -1) {
 *       builder.append(c.toChar)
 *       c = reader.read()
 *     }
 *     assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should read the first char of a temp file") {
 *     assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example, the instance variable <code>reader</code> is a <code>var</code>, so
 * it can be reinitialized between tests by the <code>beforeEach</code> method. If you
 * want to execute code before and after all tests (and nested suites) in a suite, such
 * as you could do with <code>@BeforeClass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code>
 * annotations in JUnit 4, you can use the <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code>
 * methods of <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>. See the documentation for <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> for
 * an example.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Test groups</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>Spec</code>'s tests may be classified into named <em>groups</em>.
 * As with any suite, when executing a <code>Spec</code>, groups of tests can
 * optionally be included and/or excluded. To place <code>Spec</code> tests into
 * groups, you pass objects that extend abstract class <code>org.scalatest.Tag</code> to the methods
 * that register tests, <code>it</code> and <code>ignore</code>. Class <code>Tag</code> takes one parameter,
 * a string name.  If you have
 * created Java annotation interfaces for use as group names in direct subclasses of <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>,
 * then you will probably want to use group names on your <code>Spec</code>s that match. To do so, simply 
 * pass the fully qualified names of the Java interfaces to the <code>Tag</code> constructor. For example, if you've
 * defined Java annotation interfaces with fully qualified names, <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> and <code>com.mycompany.groups.DBTest</code>, then you could
 * create matching groups for <code>Spec</code>s like this:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Tag
 *
 * object SlowTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest")
 * object DBTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.groups.DBTest")
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Given these definitions, you could place <code>Spec</code> tests into groups like this:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 *
 * class MySuite extends Spec {
 *
 *   it("should add correctly", SlowTest) {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *   }
 *
 *   it("should subtract correctly", SlowTest, DBTest) {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *     assert(diff - 2 === 1)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This code places both tests into the <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> group, 
 * and test <code>"should subtract correctly"</code> into the <code>com.mycompany.groups.DBTest</code> group.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The primary execute method takes two <code>Set[String]</code>s called <code>groupsToInclude</code> and
 * <code>groupsToExclude</code>. If <code>groupsToInclude</code> is empty, all tests will be executed
 * except those those belonging to groups listed in the
 * <code>groupsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>groupsToInclude</code> is non-empty, only tests
 * belonging to groups mentioned in <code>groupsToInclude</code>, and not mentioned in <code>groupsToExclude</code>,
 * will be executed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Ignored tests</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support the common use case of &#8220;temporarily&#8221; disabling a test, with the
 * good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>Spec</code> provides registration
 * methods that start with <code>ignore</code> instead of <code>it</code>. For example, to temporarily
 * disable the test with the name <code>"should pop values in last-in-first-out order"</code>, just change &#8220;<code>it</code>&#8221; into &#8220;<code>ignore</code>,&#8221; like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 *
 * class StackSpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   describe("A Stack") {
 *
 *     ignore("should pop values in last-in-first-out order") {
 *       val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *       stack.push(1)
 *       stack.push(2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 1)
 *     }
 *
 *     it("should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped") {
 *       val emptyStack = new Stack[String]
 *       intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
 *         emptyStack.pop()
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this version of <code>StackSpec</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scala> (new StackSpec).run()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run only the second test and report that the first test was ignored:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * A Stack
 * - should pop values in last-in-first-out order !!! IGNORED !!!
 * - should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * As with <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>, the ignore feature is implemented as a group. The
 * <code>execute</code> method that takes no parameters
 * adds <code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> to the <code>groupsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code> it passes to
 * the primary <code>execute</code> method, as does <code>Runner</code>. The only difference between
 * <code>org.scalatest.Ignore</code> and the groups you may define and exclude is that ScalaTest reports
 * ignored tests to the <code>Reporter</code>. The reason ScalaTest reports ignored tests is as a feeble
 * attempt to encourage ignored tests to be eventually fixed and added back into the active suite of tests.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Pending tests</strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
 * pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
 * out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
 * the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
 * what tests and functionality to implement later.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
 * bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
 * sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
 * it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
 * Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
 * sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
 * the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
 * with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
 * the actual test, and possibly the functionality, has not yet been implemented.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can mark a test as pending in <code>Spec</code> by placing "<code>(pending)</code>" after the 
 * test name, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.Spec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 *
 * class StackSpec extends Spec {
 *
 *   describe("A Stack") {
 *
 *     it("should pop values in last-in-first-out order") {
 *       val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *       stack.push(1)
 *       stack.push(2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 1)
 *     }
 *
 *     it("should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped") (pending)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * (Note: "<code>(pending)</code>" is the body of the test. Thus the test contains just one statement, an invocation
 * of the <code>pending</code> method, which throws <code>TestPendingException</code>.)
 * If you run this version of <code>StackSpec</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scala> (new StackSpec).run()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run both tests, but report that the test named "<code>A stack should pop values in last-in-first-out order</code>" is pending. You'll see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * A Stack 
 * - should pop values in last-in-first-out order
 * - should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped (pending)
 * </pre>
