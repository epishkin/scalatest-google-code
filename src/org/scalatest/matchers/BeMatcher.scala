/**
 * <h2>Writing custom <code>BeMatchers</code></h2>
 *
 * If you want to create a new way of using <code>be</code>, which doesn't map to an actual property on the
 * type you care about, you can create a <code>BeMatcher</code>. You could use this, for example, to create <code>BeMatcher[Int]</code>
 * called <code>odd</code>, which would match any odd <code>Int</code>, and <code>even</code>, which would match
 * any even <code>Int</code>. 
 * Given this pair of <code>BeMatcher</code>s, you could check whether an <code>Int</code> was odd or even with expressions like:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="indent">
 * num should be (odd)
 * num should not be (even)
 * </pre>
 *
 * For more information, see the documentation for <a href="BeMatcher.html"><code>BeMatcher</code></a>.
