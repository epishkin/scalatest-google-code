/**
 * A Scala port of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/multithreadedtc/">MultithreadedTC</a>
 * (also <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/multithreadedtc/overview.html">here</a>)
 * which was built by Bill Pugh and Nat Ayewah at the University of Maryland.
 *
 * <blockquote>"The MultithreadedTC framework was created to make it easier to test small concurrent abstractions.
 * It enables test designers to guarantee a specific interleaving of two or more threads,
 * even in the presence of blocking and timing issues."</blockquote>
 *
 * <blockquote>"MultithreadedTC is a framework for testing concurrent applications.
 * It features a metronome that is used to provide fine control over the sequence
 * of activities in multiple threads."</blockquote>
 *
 * The Scala version offers significant API improvements over the original Java version,
 * while maintaining most of the intent. Some original ideas were introduced, while some
 * non-scala-like features were cut.
