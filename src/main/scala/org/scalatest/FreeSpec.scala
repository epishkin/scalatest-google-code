/**
 * Trait that facilitates a &#8220;behavior-driven&#8221; style of development (BDD), in which tests
 * are nested inside text clauses denoted with the dash operator (<code>-</code>).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Trait <code>FreeSpec</code> is so named because unlike traits such as <code>WordSpec</code>, <code>FlatSpec</code>, and <code>Spec</code>,
 * it is enforces no structure on the text. You are free to compose text however you like. (A <code>FreeSpec</code> is like free-verse poetry as
 * opposed to a sonnet or haiku, which defines a structure for the text of the poem.)
 * Here's an example <code>FreeSpec</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 *
 * class StackSpec extends FreeSpec {
 *
 *   "A Stack" - {
 *
 *     "should pop values in last-in-first-out order" in {
 *       val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *       stack.push(1)
 *       stack.push(2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 1)
 *     }
 *
 *     "should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped" in {
 *       val emptyStack = new Stack[String]
 *       intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
 *         emptyStack.pop()
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In a <code>FreeSpec</code> you write a test with a string followed by <code>in</code> and the body of the
 * test in curly braces, like this:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * "should pop values in last-in-first-out order" in {
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can nest a test inside any number of description clauses, which you write with a string followed by a dash character
 * and a block, like this:  
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * "A Stack" - {
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can nest description clauses as deeply as you want. Because the description clause is denoted with an operator, not
 * a word like <code>should</code>, you are free to structure the text however you wish. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 * 
 * class StackSpec extends FreeSpec {
 *   "A Stack" - {
 *     "whenever it is empty" - {
 *       "certainly ought to" - {
 *         "be empty" in {
 *           // ...
 *         }
 *         "complain on peek" in {
 *           // ...
 *         }
 *         "complain on pop" in {
 *           // ...
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *     "but when full, by contrast, must" - {
 *       "be full" in {
 *         // ...
 *       }
 *       "complain on push" in {
 *         // ...
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Running the above <code>StackSpec</code> in the interpreter would yield:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala> (new StackSpec).execute()
 * <span class="stGreen">StackSpec:
 * A Stack 
 *   whenever it is empty 
 *     certainly ought to 
 * &nbsp;   - be empty
 * &nbsp;   - complain on peek
 * &nbsp;   - complain on pop
 * &nbsp; but when full, by contrast, must 
 * &nbsp; - be full
 * &nbsp; - complain on push</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FreeSpec</code> can also be used to write a specification-style test in languages other than English. For
 * example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 *
 * class ComputerRoomRulesSpec extends FreeSpec {
 *   "Achtung!" - {
 *     "Alle touristen und non-technischen lookenpeepers!" - {
 *       "Das machine is nicht fuer fingerpoken und mittengrabben." in {
 *         // ...
 *       }
 *       "Is easy" - {
 *         "schnappen der springenwerk" in {
 *           // ...
 *         }
 *         "blowenfusen" in {
 *           // ...
 *         }
 *         "und poppencorken mit spitzen sparken." in {
 *           // ...
 *         }
 *       }
 *       "Das machine is diggen by experten only." in {
 *         // ...
 *       }
 *       "Is nicht fuer gerwerken by das dummkopfen." in {
 *         // ...
 *       }
 *       "Das rubbernecken sightseeren keepen das cottenpicken hands in das pockets." in {
 *         // ...
 *       }
 *       "Relaxen und watchen das blinkenlights." in {
 *         // ...
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Running the above <code>ComputerRoomRulesSpec</code> in the interpreter would yield:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">(new ComputerRoomRulesSpec).execute()
 * ComputerRoomRulesSpec:

 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FreeSpec</code>'s lifecycle has two phases: the <em>registration</em> phase and the
 * <em>ready</em> phase. It starts in registration phase and enters ready phase the first time
 * <code>run</code> is called on it. It then remains in ready phase for the remainder of its lifetime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Tests can only be registered while the <code>FreeSpec</code> is
 * in its registration phase. Any attempt to register a test after the <code>FreeSpec</code> has
 * entered its ready phase, <em>i.e.</em>, after <code>run</code> has been invoked on the <code>FreeSpec</code>,
 * will be met with a thrown <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>. The recommended style
 * of using <code>FreeSpec</code> is to register tests during object construction as is done in all
 * the examples shown here. If you keep to the recommended style, you should never see a
 * <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: In BDD, the word <em>example</em> is usually used instead of <em>test</em>. The word test will not appear
 * in your code if you use <code>FreeSpec</code>, so if you prefer the word <em>example</em> you can use it. However, in this documentation
 * the word <em>test</em> will be used, for clarity and to be consistent with the rest of ScalaTest.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Shared fixtures</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A test <em>fixture</em> is objects or other artifacts (such as files, sockets, database
 * connections, etc.) used by tests to do their work. You can use fixtures in
 * <code>FreeSpec</code>s with the same approaches suggested for <code>Suite</code> in
 * its documentation. The same text that appears in the test fixture
 * section of <code>Suite</code>'s documentation is repeated here, with examples changed from
 * <code>Suite</code> to <code>FreeSpec</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a fixture is used by only one test, then the definitions of the fixture objects can
 * be local to the test function, such as the objects assigned to <code>stack</code> and <code>emptyStack</code> in the
 * previous <code>StackSpec</code> examples. If multiple tests need to share an immutable fixture, one approach
 * is to assign them to instance variables. Here's a (very contrived) example, in which the object assigned
 * to <code>shared</code> is used by multiple test functions:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 *
 * class ArithmeticSpec extends FreeSpec {
 *
 *   // Sharing immutable fixture objects via instance variables
 *   val shared = 5
 *
 *  "The Scala language" - {
 *     "should add correctly" in {
 *       val sum = 2 + 3
 *       assert(sum === shared)
 *     }
 *
 *     "should subtract correctly" in {
 *       val diff = 7 - 2
 *       assert(diff === shared)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In some cases, however, shared <em>mutable</em> fixture objects may be changed by tests such that
 * they need to be recreated or reinitialized before each test. Shared resources such
 * as files or database connections may also need to be created and initialized before, and
 * cleaned up after, each test. JUnit offers methods <code>setUp</code> and
 * <code>tearDown</code> for this purpose. In ScalaTest, you can use the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> trait,
 * which will be described later, to implement an approach similar to JUnit's <code>setUp</code>
 * and <code>tearDown</code>, however, this approach often involves reassigning <code>var</code>s
 * between tests. Before going that route, you should consider some approaches that
 * avoid <code>var</code>s. One approach is to write one or more <em>create-fixture</em> methods
 * that return a new instance of a needed object (or a tuple or case class holding new instances of
 * multiple objects) each time it is called. You can then call a create-fixture method at the beginning of each
 * test that needs the fixture, storing the fixture object or objects in local variables. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class MySuite extends FreeSpec {
 *
 *   // create objects needed by tests and return as a tuple
 *   def createFixture = (
 *     new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is "),
 *     new ListBuffer[String]
 *   )
 *
 *  "ScalaTest" - {
 *
 *     "should be easy " in {
 *       val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
 *       builder.append("easy!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *       assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *       lbuf += "sweet"
 *     }
 *
 *     "should be fun" in {
 *       val (builder, lbuf) = createFixture
 *       builder.append("fun!")
 *       assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *       assert(lbuf.isEmpty)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If different tests in the same <code>FreeSpec</code> require different fixtures, you can create multiple create-fixture methods and
 * call the method (or methods) needed by each test at the begining of the test. If every test requires the same set of
 * mutable fixture objects, one other approach you can take is make them simply <code>val</code>s and mix in trait
 * <a href="OneInstancePerTest.html"><code>OneInstancePerTest</code></a>.  If you mix in <code>OneInstancePerTest</code>, each test
 * will be run in its own instance of the <code>FreeSpec</code>, similar to the way JUnit tests are executed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although the create-fixture and <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> approaches take care of setting up a fixture before each
 * test, they don't address the problem of cleaning up a fixture after the test completes. In this situation,
 * one option is to mix in the <a href="BeforeAndAfterEach.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code></a> trait.
 * <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>'s <code>beforeEach</code> method will be run before, and its <code>afterEach</code>
 * method after, each test (like JUnit's <code>setUp</code>  and <code>tearDown</code>
 * methods, respectively). 
 * For example, you could create a temporary file before each test, and delete it afterwords, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 * import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterEach
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 *
 * class MySuite extends FreeSpec with BeforeAndAfterEach {
 *
 *   private val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *   private var reader: FileReader = _
 *
 *   // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *   override def beforeEach() {
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *   }
 *
 *   // Close and delete the temp file
 *   override def afterEach() {
 *     reader.close()
 *     val file = new File(FileName)
 *     file.delete()
 *   }
 *
 *  "A FileReader" - {
 *     "must read in the contents of a file correctly" in {
 *       var builder = new StringBuilder
 *       var c = reader.read()
 *       while (c != -1) {
 *         builder.append(c.toChar)
 *         c = reader.read()
 *       }
 *       assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *     }
 * 
 *     "must read in the first character of a file correctly" in {
 *       assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *     }
 *
 *     "not be required" in {
 *       assert(1 + 1 === 2)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example, the instance variable <code>reader</code> is a <code>var</code>, so
 * it can be reinitialized between tests by the <code>beforeEach</code> method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach should be familiar to the users of most
 * test other frameworks, ScalaTest provides another alternative that also allows you to perform cleanup
 * after each test: overriding <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code>.
 * To execute each test, <code>Suite</code>'s implementation of the <code>runTest</code> method wraps an invocation
 * of the appropriate test method in a no-arg function. <code>runTest</code> passes that test function to the <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code>
 * method, which is responsible for actually running the test by invoking the function. <code>Suite</code>'s
 * implementation of <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> simply invokes the function, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * // Default implementation
 * protected def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {
 *   test()
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>withFixture(NoArgTest)</code> method exists so that you can override it and set a fixture up before, and clean it up after, each test.
 * Thus, the previous temp file example could also be implemented without mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 * import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterEach
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 *
 * class MySuite extends FreeSpec {
 *
 *   private var reader: FileReader = _
 *
 *   override def withFixture(test: NoArgTest) {
 *
 *     val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *
 *     // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *
 *     try {
 *       test() // Invoke the test function
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       // Close and delete the temp file
 *       reader.close()
 *       val file = new File(FileName)
 *       file.delete()
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *  "A FileReader" - {
 *     "must read in the contents of a file correctly" in {
 *       var builder = new StringBuilder
 *       var c = reader.read()
 *       while (c != -1) {
 *         builder.append(c.toChar)
 *         c = reader.read()
 *       }
 *       assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *     }
 * 
 *     "must read in the first character of a file correctly" in {
 *       assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *     }
 *
 *     "must not be required" in {
 *       assert(1 + 1 === 2)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you prefer to keep your test classes immutable, one final variation is to use the
 * <a href="fixture/FixtureFreeSpec.html"><code>FixtureFreeSpec</code></a> trait from the
 * <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> package.  Tests in an <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureFreeSpec</code> can have a fixture
 * object passed in as a parameter. You must indicate the type of the fixture object
 * by defining the <code>Fixture</code> type member and define a <code>withFixture</code> method that takes a <em>one-arg</em> test function.
 * (A <code>FixtureFreeSpec</code> has two overloaded <code>withFixture</code> methods, therefore, one that takes a <code>OneArgTest</code>
 * and the other, inherited from <code>Suite</code>, that takes a <code>NoArgTest</code>.)
 * Inside the <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method, you create the fixture, pass it into the test function, then perform any
 * necessary cleanup after the test function returns. Instead of invoking each test directly, a <code>FixtureFreeSpec</code> will
 * pass a function that invokes the code of a test to <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code>. Your <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method, therefore,
 * is responsible for actually running the code of the test by invoking the test function.
 * For example, you could pass the temp file reader fixture to each test that needs it
 * by overriding the <code>withFixture(OneArgTest)</code> method of a <code>FixtureFreeSpec</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureFreeSpec
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 * 
 * class MySuite extends FixtureFreeSpec {
 *
 *   type FixtureParam = FileReader
 *
 *   def withFixture(test: OneArgTest) {
 *
 *     val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *
 *     // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     val reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *  
 *     try {
 *       // Run the test using the temp file
 *       test(reader)
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       // Close and delete the temp file
 *       reader.close()
 *       val file = new File(FileName)
 *       file.delete()
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *  "A FileReader" - {
 *     "must read in the contents of a file correctly" in { reader =>
 *       var builder = new StringBuilder
 *       var c = reader.read()
 *       while (c != -1) {
 *         builder.append(c.toChar)
 *         c = reader.read()
 *       }
 *       assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *     }
 * 
 *     "must read in the first character of a file correctly" in { reader =>
 *       assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *     }
 *
 *     "must not be required" in { () =>
 *       assert(1 + 1 === 2)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is worth noting that the only difference in the test code between the mutable
 * <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach shown here and the immutable <code>FixtureFreeSpec</code>
 * approach shown previously is that two of the <code>FixtureFreeSpec</code>'s test functions take a <code>FileReader</code> as
 * a parameter via the "<code>reader =></code>" at the beginning of the function. Otherwise the test code is identical.
 * One benefit of the explicit parameter is that, as demonstrated
 * by the "<code>A FileReader must not be required</code>" test, a <code>FixtureFreeSpec</code>
 * test need not take the fixture. So you can have some tests that take a fixture, and others that don't.
 * In this case, the <code>FixtureFreeSpec</code> provides documentation indicating which
 * tests use the fixture and which don't, whereas the <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> approach does not.
 * (If you have want to combine tests that take different fixture types in the same <code>FreeSpec</code>, you can
 * use <a href="fixture/MultipleFixtureFreeSpec.html">MultipleFixtureFreeSpec</a>.)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you want to execute code before and after all tests (and nested suites) in a suite, such
 * as you could do with <code>@BeforeClass</code> and <code>@AfterClass</code>
 * annotations in JUnit 4, you can use the <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code>
 * methods of <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code>. See the documentation for <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> for
 * an example.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="SharedTests"></a><h2>Shared tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you may want to run the same test code on different fixture objects. In other words, you may want to write tests that are "shared"
 * by different fixture objects.  To accomplish this in a <code>FreeSpec</code>, you first place shared tests in <em>behavior functions</em>.
 * These behavior functions will be invoked during the construction phase of any <code>FreeSpec</code> that uses them, so that the tests they
 * contain will be registered as tests in that <code>FreeSpec</code>.  For example, given this stack class:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class Stack[T] {
 *
 *   val MAX = 10
 *   private var buf = new ListBuffer[T]
 *
 *   def push(o: T) {
 *     if (!full)
 *       o +: buf
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't push onto a full stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def pop(): T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf.remove(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def peek: T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def full: Boolean = buf.size == MAX
 *   def empty: Boolean = buf.size == 0
 *   def size = buf.size
 *
 *   override def toString = buf.mkString("Stack(", ", ", ")")
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You may want to test the <code>Stack</code> class in different states: empty, full, with one item, with one item less than capacity,
 * <em>etc</em>. You may find you have several tests that make sense any time the stack is non-empty. Thus you'd ideally want to run
 * those same tests for three stack fixture objects: a full stack, a stack with a one item, and a stack with one item less than
 * capacity. With shared tests, you can factor these tests out into a behavior function, into which you pass the
 * stack fixture to use when running the tests. So in your <code>FreeSpec</code> for stack, you'd invoke the
 * behavior function three times, passing in each of the three stack fixtures so that the shared tests are run for all three fixtures. You
 * can define a behavior function that encapsulates these shared tests inside the <code>FreeSpec</code> that uses them. If they are shared
 * between different <code>FreeSpec</code>s, however, you could also define them in a separate trait that is mixed into each <code>FreeSpec</code>
 * that uses them.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <a name="StackBehaviors">For</a> example, here the <code>nonEmptyStack</code> behavior function (in this case, a behavior <em>method</em>) is
 * defined in a trait along with another method containing shared tests for non-full stacks:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * trait StackBehaviors { this: FreeSpec =>
 * 
 *   def nonEmptyStack(stack: Stack[Int], lastItemAdded: Int) {
 * 
 *     "be non-empty" in {
 *       assert(!stack.empty)
 *     }  
 * 
 *     "return the top item on peek" in {

 *
 * <p>
 * Given these behavior functions, you could invoke them directly, but <code>FreeSpec</code> offers a DSL for the purpose,
 * which looks like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * behave like nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed)
 * behave like nonFullStack(stackWithOneItem)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you prefer to use an imperative style to change fixtures, for example by mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> and
 * reassigning a <code>stack</code> <code>var</code> in <code>beforeEach</code>, you could write your behavior functions
 * in the context of that <code>var</code>, which means you wouldn't need to pass in the stack fixture because it would be
 * in scope already inside the behavior function. In that case, your code would look like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * behave like nonEmptyStack // assuming lastValuePushed is also in scope inside nonEmptyStack
 * behave like nonFullStack
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The recommended style, however, is the functional, pass-all-the-needed-values-in style. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">

 * If you load these classes into the Scala interpreter (with scalatest's JAR file on the class path), and execute it,

 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One thing to keep in mind when using shared tests is that in ScalaTest, each test in a suite must have a unique name.
 * If you register the same tests repeatedly in the same suite, one problem you may encounter is an exception at runtime
 * complaining that multiple tests are being registered with the same test name. A good way to solve this problem in a <code>FreeSpec</code> is to make sure
 * each test is in the context of different surrounding description clauses,
 * because a test's name is the concatenation of its surrounding clauses, followed by the test's text.
 * For example, the following code in a <code>FreeSpec</code> would register a test with the name <code>"A Stack when empty should be empty"</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * "A Stack" - {
 *   "when empty" - {
 *     "should be empty" in {
 *       assert(emptyStack.empty)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * // ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the <code>"should be empty"</code> test was factored out into a behavior function, it could be called repeatedly so long
 * as each invocation of the behavior function is in the context of a different surrounding description (dash) clauses.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Tagging tests</h2>
 *
 * A <code>FreeSpec</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names.
 * As with any suite, when executing a <code>FreeSpec</code>, groups of tests can
 * optionally be included and/or excluded. To tag a <code>FreeSpec</code>'s tests,
 * you pass objects that extend abstract class <code>org.scalatest.Tag</code> to <code>taggedAs</code> method
 * invoked on the string that describes the test you want to tag. Class <code>Tag</code> takes one parameter,
 * a string name.  If you have
 * created Java annotation interfaces for use as group names in direct subclasses of <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>,
 * then you will probably want to use group names on your <code>FreeSpec</code>s that match. To do so, simply 
 * pass the fully qualified names of the Java interfaces to the <code>Tag</code> constructor. For example, if you've
 * defined Java annotation interfaces with fully qualified names, <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> and <code>com.mycompany.groups.DbTest</code>, then you could
 * create matching tags for <code>Spec</code>s like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.Tag
 *
 * object SlowTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.tags.SlowTest")
 * object DbTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.tags.DbTest")
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given these definitions, you could tag <code>FreeSpec</code> tests like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 *
 * class MySuite extends FreeSpec {
 *
 *   "The Scala language" - {
 *
 *     "should add correctly" taggedAs(SlowTest) in {
 *       val sum = 1 + 1
 *       assert(sum === 2)
 *     }
 *
 *     "should subtract correctly" taggedAs(SlowTest, DbTest) in {
 *       val diff = 4 - 1
 *       assert(diff === 3)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This code marks both tests with the <code>com.mycompany.tags.SlowTest</code> tag, 
 * and test <code>"The Scala language should subtract correctly"</code> with the <code>com.mycompany.tags.DbTest</code> tag.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
 * <code>Set[String]</code> called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
 * except those those belonging to tags listed in the
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
 * belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
 * will be run.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Ignored tests</h2>
 *
 * To support the common use case of &#8220;temporarily&#8221; disabling a test, with the
 * good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>FreeSpec</code> adds a method
 * <code>ignore</code> to strings that can be used instead of <code>in</code> to register a test. For example, to temporarily
 * disable the test with the name <code>"A Stack should pop values in last-in-first-out order"</code>, just
 * change &#8220;<code>in</code>&#8221; into &#8220;<code>ignore</code>,&#8221; like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 *
 * class StackSpec extends FreeSpec {
 *
 *   "A Stack" - {
 *
 *     "should pop values in last-in-first-out order" ignore {
 *       val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *       stack.push(1)
 *       stack.push(2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 2)
 *       assert(stack.pop() === 1)
 *     }
 *
 *     "should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped" in {
 *       val emptyStack = new Stack[String]
 *       intercept[NoSuchElementException] {
 *         emptyStack.pop()
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this version of <code>StackSpec</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala> (new StackSpec).execute()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run only the second test and report that the first test was ignored:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">StackSpec:
 * A Stack</span>
 * <span class="stYellow">- should pop values in last-in-first-out order !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
 * <span class="stGreen">- should throw NoSuchElementException if an empty stack is popped</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Informers</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * One of the parameters to the primary <code>run</code> method is a <code>Reporter</code>, which
 * will collect and report information about the running suite of tests.
 * Information about suites and tests that were run, whether tests succeeded or failed, 
 * and tests that were ignored will be passed to the <code>Reporter</code> as the suite runs.
 * Most often the reporting done by default by <code>FreeSpec</code>'s methods will be sufficient, but
 * occasionally you may wish to provide custom information to the <code>Reporter</code> from a test.
 * For this purpose, an <code>Informer</code> that will forward information to the current <code>Reporter</code>
 * is provided via the <code>info</code> parameterless method.
 * You can pass the extra information to the <code>Informer</code> via its <code>apply</code> method.
 * The <code>Informer</code> will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> via an <code>InfoProvided</code> event.
 * Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 *
 * class ArithmeticSpec extends FreeSpec {
 *
 *  "The Scala language" - {
 *     "should add correctly" in {
 *       val sum = 2 + 3
 *       assert(sum === 5)
 *       info("addition seems to work")
 *     }
 *
 *     "should subtract correctly" in {
 *       val diff = 7 - 2
 *       assert(diff === 5)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this <code>FreeSpec</code> from the interpreter, you will see the following message
 * included in the printed report:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala> (new ArithmeticSpec).execute()
 * <span class="stGreen">ArithmeticSpec:
 * The Scala language 
 * - should add correctly
 *   + addition seems to work 
 * - should subtract correctly</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * One use case for the <code>Informer</code> is to pass more information about a specification to the reporter. For example,
 * the <code>GivenWhenThen</code> trait provides methods that use the implicit <code>info</code> provided by <code>FreeSpec</code>
 * to pass such information to the reporter. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 * import org.scalatest.GivenWhenThen
 * 
 * class ArithmeticSpec extends FreeSpec with GivenWhenThen {
 * 
 *  "The Scala language" - {
 * 
 *     "should add correctly" in { 
 * 
 *       given("two integers")
 *       val x = 2
 *       val y = 3
 * 
 *       when("they are added")
 *       val sum = x + y
 * 
 *       then("the result is the sum of the two numbers")
 *       assert(sum === 5)
 *     }
 * 
 *     "should subtract correctly" in {
 * 
 *       given("two integers")
 *       val x = 7
 *       val y = 2
 * 
 *       when("one is subtracted from the other")
 *       val diff = x - y
 * 
 *       then("the result is the difference of the two numbers")
 *       assert(diff === 5)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this <code>FreeSpec</code> from the interpreter, you will see the following messages
 * included in the printed report:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala> (new ArithmeticSpec).execute()
 * <span class="stGreen">ArithmeticSpec:

 * - should subtract correctly
 *   + Given two integers 
 *   + When one is subtracted from the other 
 *   + Then the result is the difference of the two numbers</span> 
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Pending tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
 * pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
 * out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, before the behavior of
 * the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
 * what tests and functionality to implement later.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
 * bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
 * sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
 * it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
 * sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
 * the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
 * with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
 * the actual test, and possibly the functionality it is intended to test, has not yet been implemented.
 * You can mark tests as pending in a <code>FreeSpec</code> like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FreeSpec
 *
 * class ArithmeticSpec extends FreeSpec {
 *
 *   // Sharing fixture objects via instance variables
 *   val shared = 5
 *
 *  "The Scala language" - {
 *     "should add correctly" in {
 *       val sum = 2 + 3
 *       assert(sum === shared)
 *     }
 *
 *     "should subtract correctly" is (pending)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this version of <code>ArithmeticSpec</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala> (new ArithmeticSpec).execute()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run both tests but report that <code>The Scala language should subtract correctly</code> is pending. You'll see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">The Scala language
 * - should add correctly</span>
 * <span class="stYellow">- should subtract correctly (pending)</span>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One difference between an ignored test and a pending one is that an ignored test is intended to be used during a
 * significant refactorings of the code under test, when tests break and you don't want to spend the time to fix
 * all of them immediately. You can mark some of those broken tests as ignored temporarily, so that you can focus the red
 * bar on just failing tests you actually want to fix immediately. Later you can go back and fix the ignored tests.
 * In other words, by ignoring some failing tests temporarily, you can more easily notice failed tests that you actually
 * want to fix. By contrast, a pending test is intended to be used before a test and/or the code under test is written.
 * Pending indicates you've decided to write a test for a bit of behavior, but either you haven't written the test yet, or
 * have only written part of it, or perhaps you've written the test but don't want to implement the behavior it tests
 * until after you've implemented a different bit of behavior you realized you need first. Thus ignored tests are designed
 * to facilitate refactoring of existing code whereas pending tests are designed to facilitate the creation of new code.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * One other difference between ignored and pending tests is that ignored tests are implemented as a test tag that is
 * excluded by default. Thus an ignored test is never executed. By contrast, a pending test is implemented as a
 * test that throws <code>TestPendingException</code> (which is what calling the <code>pending</code> method does). Thus
 * the body of pending tests are executed up until they throw <code>TestPendingException</code>. The reason for this difference
 * is that it enables your unfinished test to send <code>InfoProvided</code> messages to the reporter before it completes
 * abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>, as shown in the previous example on <code>Informer</code>s
 * that used the <code>GivenWhenThen</code> trait. For example, the following snippet in a <code>FreeSpec</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 *  "The Scala language" should {
 *     "add correctly" in { 
 *       given("two integers")
 *       when("they are added")
 *       then("the result is the sum of the two numbers")
 *       pending
 *     }
 *     // ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Would yield the following output when run in the interpreter:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">The Scala language</span>
 * <span class="stYellow">- should add correctly (pending)
 *   + Given two integers 
 *   + When they are added 
 *   + Then the result is the sum of the two numbers</span> 
 * </pre>
