/**
 * <strong>FixtureSpec has been deprecated and will be removed in a future
 * release of ScalaTest. Please change any uses of <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureSpec</code>
 * to a corresponding use of <a href="FunSpec.html"><code>org.scalatest.fixture.FunSpec</code></a>.</strong>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <strong> This is just
 * a rename, so the only thing you need to do is change the name. However, the recommended way to
 * write it is to import <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> and then write <code>fixture.FunSpec</code> when
 * you use it, to differentiate it more clearly from <code>org.scalatest.FunSpec</code>. For example:
 * </strong>
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.fixture
 *
 * class ExampleSpec extends fixture.FunSpec {
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
