/**
 * A sister trait to <code>org.scalatest.FeatureSpec</code> that can pass a fixture object into its tests.
 *
 * <p>
 * This trait behaves similarly to trait <code>org.scalatest.FeatureSpec</code>, except that tests may take a fixture object. The type of the
 * fixture object passed is defined by the abstract <code>Fixture</code> type, which is declared as a member of this trait (inherited
 * from supertrait <code>FixtureSuite</code>).
 * This trait also inherits the abstract method <code>withFixture</code> from supertrait <code>FixtureSuite</code>. The <code>withFixture</code> method
 * takes a <code>OneArgTest</code>, which is a nested trait defined as a member of supertrait <code>FixtureSuite</code>.
 * <code>OneArgTest</code> has an <code>apply</code> method that takes a <code>Fixture</code>.
 * This <code>apply</code> method is responsible for running a test.
 * This trait's <code>runTest</code> method delegates the actual running of each test to <code>withFixture</code>, passing
 * in the test code to run via the <code>OneArgTest</code> argument. The <code>withFixture</code> method (abstract in this trait) is responsible
 * for creating the fixture and passing it to the test function.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Subclasses of this trait must, therefore, do three things differently from a plain old <code>org.scalatest.FeatureSpec</code>:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>define the type of the fixture object by specifying type <code>Fixture</code></li>
 * <li>define the <code>withFixture</code> method</li>
 * <li>write scenarios that take a <code>Fixture</code> (You can also define scenarios that don't take a <code>Fixture</code>.)</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureFeatureSpec
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 * 
 * class MyFeatureSpec extends FixtureFeatureSpec {
 *
 *   // 1. define type Fixture
 *   type Fixture = FileReader
 *
 *   // 2. define the withFixture method
 *   def withFixture(test: OneArgTest) {
 *
 *     val FileName = "TempFile.txt"
 *
 *     // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     val reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *  
 *     try {
 *       // Run the test using the temp file
 *       test(reader)
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       // Close and delete the temp file
 *       reader.close()
 *       val file = new File(FileName)
 *       file.delete()
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   // 3. write scenarios that take a Fixture
 *   feature("Reading and writing files") {
 *     scenario("reading from the temp file") { reader =>
 *       var builder = new StringBuilder
 *       var c = reader.read()
 *       while (c != -1) {
 *         builder.append(c.toChar)
 *         c = reader.read()
 *       }
 *       assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *     }
 * 
 *     scenario("first char of the temp file") { reader =>
 *       assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *     }
 * 
 *     // (You can also write scenarios that don't take a Fixture.)
 *     scenario("no fixture is passed") { () =>
 *       assert(1 + 1 === 2)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the fixture you want to pass into your tests consists of multiple objects, you will need to combine
 * them into one object to use this trait. One good approach to passing multiple fixture objects is
 * to encapsulate them in a tuple. Here's an example that takes the tuple approach:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureFeatureSpec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class MyFeatureSpec extends FixtureFeatureSpec {
 *
 *   type Fixture = (StringBuilder, ListBuffer[String])
 *
 *   def withFixture(test: OneArgTest) {
 *
 *     // Create needed mutable objects
 *     val stringBuilder = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *     val listBuffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 *
 *     // Invoke the test function, passing in the mutable objects
 *     test(stringBuilder, listBuffer)
 *   }
 *
 *   scenario("easy") { fixture => 
 *     val (builder, buffer) = fixture
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 *
 *   scenario("fun") { fixture =>
 *     val (builder, buffer) = fixture
 *     builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When using a tuple to pass multiple fixture objects, it is usually helpful to give names to each
 * individual object in the tuple with a pattern-match assignment, as is done at the beginning
 * of each test here with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * val (builder, buffer) = fixture
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Another good approach to passing multiple fixture objects is
 * to encapsulate them in a case class. Here's an example that takes the case class approach:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureFeatureSpec
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 *
 * class MyFeatureSpec extends FixtureFeatureSpec {
 *
 *   case class FixtureHolder(builder: StringBuilder, buffer: ListBuffer[String])
 *
 *   type Fixture = FixtureHolder
 *
 *   def withFixture(test: OneArgTest) {
 *
 *     // Create needed mutable objects
 *     val stringBuilder = new StringBuilder("ScalaTest is ")
 *     val listBuffer = new ListBuffer[String]
 *
 *     // Invoke the test function, passing in the mutable objects
 *     test(FixtureHolder(stringBuilder, listBuffer))
 *   }
 *
 *   scenario("easy") { fixture =>
 *     import fixture._
 *     builder.append("easy!")
 *     assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *     assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *     buffer += "sweet"
 *   }
 *
 *   scenario("fun") { fixture =>
 *     fixture.builder.append("fun!")
 *     assert(fixture.builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *     assert(fixture.buffer.isEmpty)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When using a case class to pass multiple fixture objects, it can be helpful to make the names of each
 * individual object available as a single identifier with an import statement. This is the approach
 * taken by the <code>testEasy</code> method in the previous example. Because it imports the members
 * of the fixture object, the test method code can just use them as unqualified identifiers:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scenario("easy") { fixture =>
 *   import fixture._
 *   builder.append("easy!")
 *   assert(builder.toString === "ScalaTest is easy!")
 *   assert(buffer.isEmpty)
 *   buffer += "sweet"
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, you may sometimes prefer to qualify each use of a fixture object with the name
 * of the fixture parameter. This approach, taken by the <code>testFun</code> method in the previous
 * example, makes it more obvious which variables in your test method
 * are part of the passed-in fixture:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * scenario("fun") { fixture =>
 *   fixture.builder.append("fun!")
 *   assert(fixture.builder.toString === "ScalaTest is fun!")
 *   assert(fixture.buffer.isEmpty)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Configuring fixtures and tests</strong>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you may want to write tests that are configurable. For example, you may want to write
 * a suite of tests that each take an open temp file as a fixture, but whose file name is specified
 * externally so that the file name can be can be changed from run to run. To accomplish this
 * the <code>OneArgTest</code> trait has a <code>configMap</code>
 * method, which will return a <code>Map[String, Any]</code> from which configuration information may be obtained.
 * The <code>runTest</code> method of this trait will pass a <code>OneArgTest</code> to <code>withFixture</code>
 * whose <code>configMap</code> method returns the <code>configMap</code> passed to <code>runTest</code>.
 * Here's an example in which the name of a temp file is taken from the passed <code>configMap</code>:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureFeatureSpec
 * import java.io.FileReader
 * import java.io.FileWriter
 * import java.io.File
 * 
 * class MyFeatureSpec extends FixtureFeatureSpec {
 *
 *   type Fixture = FileReader
 *
 *   def withFixture(test: OneArgTest) {
 *
 *     require(
 *       test.configMap.contains("TempFileName"),
 *       "This suite requires a TempFileName to be passed in the configMap"
 *     )
 *
 *     // Grab the file name from the configMap
 *     val FileName = test.configMap("TempFileName")
 *
 *     // Set up the temp file needed by the test
 *     val writer = new FileWriter(FileName)
 *     try {
 *       writer.write("Hello, test!")
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       writer.close()
 *     }
 *
 *     // Create the reader needed by the test
 *     val reader = new FileReader(FileName)
 *  
 *     try {
 *       // Run the test using the temp file
 *       test(reader)
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       // Close and delete the temp file
 *       reader.close()
 *       val file = new File(FileName)
 *       file.delete()
 *     }
 *   }
 * 
 *   scenario("reading from the temp file") { reader =>
 *     var builder = new StringBuilder
 *     var c = reader.read()
 *     while (c != -1) {
 *       builder.append(c.toChar)
 *       c = reader.read()
 *     }
 *     assert(builder.toString === "Hello, test!")
 *   }
 * 
 *   scenario("first char of the temp file") { reader =>
 *     assert(reader.read() === 'H')
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you want to pass into each test the entire <code>configMap</code> that was passed to <code>runTest</code>, you 
 * can mix in trait <code>ConfigMapFixture</code>. See the <a href="ConfigMapFixture.html">documentation
 * for <code>ConfigMapFixture</code></a> for the details, but here's a quick
 * example of how it looks:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *  import org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureFeatureSpec
 *  import org.scalatest.fixture.ConfigMapFixture
 *
 *  class MyFeatureSpec extends FixtureFeatureSpec with ConfigMapFixture {
 *
 *    scenario("hello") { configMap =>
 *      // Use the configMap passed to runTest in the test
 *      assert(configMap.contains("hello")
 *    }
 *
 *    scenario("world") { configMap =>
 *      assert(configMap.contains("world")
 *    }
 *  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>ConfigMapFixture</code> can also be used to facilitate writing <code>FixtureFeatureSpec</code>s that include tests
 * that take different fixture types. See the documentation for <a href="MultipleFixtureFeatureSpec.html"><code>MultipleFixtureFeatureSpec</code></a> for more information.
 * </p>

   * This method takes a <code>testName</code> parameter that optionally specifies a test to invoke.
   * If <code>testName</code> is <code>Some</code>, this trait's implementation of this method
   * invokes <code>runTest</code> on this object, passing in:
   * </p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li><code>testName</code> - the <code>String</code> value of the <code>testName</code> <code>Option</code> passed
   *   to this method</li>
   * <li><code>reporter</code> - the <code>Reporter</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li>
   * <li><code>stopper</code> - the <code>Stopper</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li>
   * <li><code>configMap</code> - the <code>configMap</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>
   * This method takes a <code>Set</code> of tag names that should be included (<code>tagsToInclude</code>), and a <code>Set</code>
   * that should be excluded (<code>tagsToExclude</code>), when deciding which of this <code>Suite</code>'s tests to execute.
   * If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is empty, all tests will be executed
   * except those those belonging to tags listed in the <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is non-empty, only tests
   * belonging to tags mentioned in <code>tagsToInclude</code>, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>
   * will be executed. However, if <code>testName</code> is <code>Some</code>, <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> are essentially ignored.
   * Only if <code>testName</code> is <code>None</code> will <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> be consulted to

   * <p>
   * If <code>testName</code> is <code>None</code>, this trait's implementation of this method
   * invokes <code>testNames</code> on this <code>Suite</code> to get a <code>Set</code> of names of tests to potentially execute.
   * (A <code>testNames</code> value of <code>None</code> essentially acts as a wildcard that means all tests in
   * this <code>Suite</code> that are selected by <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> should be executed.)
   * For each test in the <code>testName</code> <code>Set</code>, in the order
   * they appear in the iterator obtained by invoking the <code>elements</code> method on the <code>Set</code>, this trait's implementation
   * of this method checks whether the test should be run based on the <code>tagsToInclude</code> and <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>s.
   * If so, this implementation invokes <code>runTest</code>, passing in:
   * </p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li><code>testName</code> - the <code>String</code> name of the test to run (which will be one of the names in the <code>testNames</code> <code>Set</code>)</li>
   * <li><code>reporter</code> - the <code>Reporter</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li>
   * <li><code>stopper</code> - the <code>Stopper</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li>
   * <li><code>configMap</code> - the <code>configMap</code> passed to this method, or one that wraps and delegates to it</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param testName an optional name of one test to execute. If <code>None</code>, all relevant tests should be executed.
   *                 I.e., <code>None</code> acts like a wildcard that means execute all relevant tests in this <code>Spec</code>.
   * @param reporter the <code>Reporter</code> to which results will be reported
   * @param stopper the <code>Stopper</code> that will be consulted to determine whether to stop execution early.
   * @param tagsToInclude a <code>Set</code> of <code>String</code> tag names to include in the execution of this <code>Spec</code>
   * @param tagsToExclude a <code>Set</code> of <code>String</code> tag names to exclude in the execution of this <code>Spec</code>
   * @param configMap a <code>Map</code> of key-value pairs that can be used by this <code>Spec</code>'s executing tests.
