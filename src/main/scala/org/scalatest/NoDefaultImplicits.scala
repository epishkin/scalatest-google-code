/**
 * Trait that can be mixed in disable implicit conversion to Equalizer defined in Assertions:-
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * implicit def convertToEqualizer(left: Any) = new Equalizer(left)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This is to solve the problem when the above implicit conversion clashes with an implicit conversion used in the code you are trying to test, 
 * causing your program won't compile.  You can just mix in this trait to disable implicit conversion from the ScalaTest's Assertions:-
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * class MySuite extends FunSuite with NoDefaultImplicits { 
 *   // ... 
 * } 
 * </pre>
