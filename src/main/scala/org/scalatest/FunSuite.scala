/**
 * A suite of tests in which each test is represented as a function value. The &#8220;<code>Fun</code>&#8221; in <code>FunSuite</code> stands
 * for &#8220;function.&#8221; Here's an example <code>FunSuite</code>:
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   test("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction") {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * &#8220;<code>test</code>&#8221; is a method, defined in <code>FunSuite</code>, which will be invoked
 * by the primary constructor of <code>ExampleSuite</code>. You specify the name of the test as
 * a string between the parentheses, and the test code itself between curly braces.
 * The test code is a function passed as a by-name parameter to <code>test</code>, which registers
 * it for later execution. One benefit of <code>FunSuite</code> compared to <code>Suite</code> is you need not name all your
 * tests starting with &#8220;<code>test</code>.&#8221; In addition, you can more easily give long names to
 * your tests, because you need not encode them in camel case.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FunSuite</code>'s lifecycle has two phases: the <em>registration</em> phase and the
 * <em>ready</em> phase. It starts in registration phase and enters ready phase the first time
 * <code>run</code> is called on it. It then remains in ready phase for the remainder of its lifetime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Tests can only be registered with the <code>test</code> method while the <code>FunSuite</code> is
 * in its registration phase. Any attempt to register a test after the <code>FunSuite</code> has
 * entered its ready phase, <em>i.e.</em>, after <code>run</code> has been invoked on the <code>FunSuite</code>,
 * will be met with a thrown <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>. The recommended style
 * of using <code>FunSuite</code> is to register tests during object construction as is done in all
 * the examples shown here. If you keep to the recommended style, you should never see a
 * <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * See also: <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/getting_started_with_fun_suite" target="_blank">Getting started with <code>FunSuite</code>.</a>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Ignored tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support the common use case of &#8220;temporarily&#8221; disabling a test, with the
 * good intention of resurrecting the test at a later time, <code>FunSuite</code> provides registration
 * methods that start with <code>ignore</code> instead of <code>test</code>. For example, to temporarily
 * disable the test named <code>addition</code>, just change &#8220;<code>test</code>&#8221; into &#8220;<code>ignore</code>,&#8221; like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   ignore("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction") {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you run this version of <code>ExampleSuite</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run only <code>subtraction</code> and report that <code>addition</code> was ignored:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:</span>
 * <span class="stYellow">- addition !!! IGNORED !!!</span>
 * <span class="stGreen">- subtraction</span>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Informers</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * One of the parameters to the <code>run</code> method is a <code>Reporter</code>, which
 * will collect and report information about the running suite of tests.
 * Information about suites and tests that were run, whether tests succeeded or failed, 
 * and tests that were ignored will be passed to the <code>Reporter</code> as the suite runs.
 * Most often the reporting done by default by <code>FunSuite</code>'s methods will be sufficient, but
 * occasionally you may wish to provide custom information to the <code>Reporter</code> from a test.
 * For this purpose, an <code>Informer</code> that will forward information to the current <code>Reporter</code>
 * is provided via the <code>info</code> parameterless method.
 * You can pass the extra information to the <code>Informer</code> via one of its <code>apply</code> methods.
 * The <code>Informer</code> will then pass the information to the <code>Reporter</code> via an <code>InfoProvided</code> event.
 * Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   test("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *     info("Addition seems to work")
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If you run this <code>Suite</code> from the interpreter, you will see the following message
 * included in the printed report:
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:
 * - addition
 *   + Addition seems to work</span> 
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Pending tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <em>pending test</em> is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
 * pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
 * out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, before the behavior of
 * the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
 * what tests and functionality to implement later.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
 * bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
 * sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
 * it can call method <code>pending</code>, which will cause it to complete abruptly with <code>TestPendingException</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with <code>TestPendingException</code>, both the test name and any information
 * sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
 * the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
 * with <code>TestPendingException</code>, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
 * the actual test, and possibly the functionality, has not yet been implemented.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although pending tests may be used more often in specification-style suites, such as
 * <code>org.scalatest.Spec</code>, you can also use it in <code>FunSuite</code>, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   test("addition") {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *     assert(sum + 2 === 4)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction") (pending)
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * (Note: "<code>(pending)</code>" is the body of the test. Thus the test contains just one statement, an invocation
 * of the <code>pending</code> method, which throws <code>TestPendingException</code>.)
 * If you run this version of <code>ExampleSuite</code> with:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * scala> (new ExampleSuite).execute()
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * It will run both tests, but report that <code>subtraction</code> is pending. You'll see:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stREPL">
 * <span class="stGreen">ExampleSuite:
 * - addition</span>
 * <span class="stYellow">- subtraction (pending)</span>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Tagging tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * A <code>FunSuite</code>'s tests may be classified into groups by <em>tagging</em> them with string names.
 * As with any suite, when executing a <code>FunSuite</code>, groups of tests can
 * optionally be included and/or excluded. To tag a <code>FunSuite</code>'s tests,
 * you pass objects that extend abstract class <code>org.scalatest.Tag</code> to methods
 * that register tests, <code>test</code> and <code>ignore</code>. Class <code>Tag</code> takes one parameter, a string name.  If you have
 * created Java annotation interfaces for use as group names in direct subclasses of <code>org.scalatest.Suite</code>,
 * then you will probably want to use group names on your <code>FunSuite</code>s that match. To do so, simply 
 * pass the fully qualified names of the Java interfaces to the <code>Tag</code> constructor. For example, if you've
 * defined Java annotation interfaces with fully qualified names, <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> and
 * <code>com.mycompany.groups.DbTest</code>, then you could
 * create matching groups for <code>FunSuite</code>s like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.Tag
 *
 * object SlowTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest")
 * object DbTest extends Tag("com.mycompany.groups.DbTest")
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given these definitions, you could place <code>FunSuite</code> tests into groups like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 *
 * class ExampleSuite extends FunSuite {
 *
 *   test("addition", SlowTest) {
 *     val sum = 1 + 1
 *     assert(sum === 2)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("subtraction", SlowTest, DbTest) {
 *     val diff = 4 - 1
 *     assert(diff === 3)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This code marks both tests, "addition" and "subtraction," with the <code>com.mycompany.groups.SlowTest</code> tag, 
 * and test "subtraction" with the <code>com.mycompany.groups.DbTest</code> tag.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>run</code> method takes a <code>Filter</code>, whose constructor takes an optional
 * <code>Set[String]</code> called <code>tagsToInclude</code> and a <code>Set[String]</code> called
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is <code>None</code>, all tests will be run
 * except those those belonging to tags listed in the
 * <code>tagsToExclude</code> <code>Set</code>. If <code>tagsToInclude</code> is defined, only tests
 * belonging to tags mentioned in the <code>tagsToInclude</code> set, and not mentioned in <code>tagsToExclude</code>,
 * will be run.
 * </p>
 *
 * <a name="SharedTests"></a><h2>Shared tests</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Sometimes you may want to run the same test code on different fixture objects. In other words, you may want to write tests that are "shared"
 * by different fixture objects.
 * To accomplish this in a <code>FunSuite</code>, you first place shared tests in
 * <em>behavior functions</em>. These behavior functions will be
 * invoked during the construction phase of any <code>FunSuite</code> that uses them, so that the tests they contain will
 * be registered as tests in that <code>FunSuite</code>.
 * For example, given this stack class:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
 * 
 * class Stack[T] {
 *
 *   val MAX = 10
 *   private var buf = new ListBuffer[T]
 *
 *   def push(o: T) {
 *     if (!full)
 *       o +: buf
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't push onto a full stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def pop(): T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf.remove(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def peek: T = {
 *     if (!empty)
 *       buf(0)
 *     else
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("can't pop an empty stack")
 *   }
 *
 *   def full: Boolean = buf.size == MAX
 *   def empty: Boolean = buf.size == 0
 *   def size = buf.size
 *
 *   override def toString = buf.mkString("Stack(", ", ", ")")
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You may want to test the <code>Stack</code> class in different states: empty, full, with one item, with one item less than capacity,
 * <em>etc</em>. You may find you have several tests that make sense any time the stack is non-empty. Thus you'd ideally want to run
 * those same tests for three stack fixture objects: a full stack, a stack with a one item, and a stack with one item less than
 * capacity. With shared tests, you can factor these tests out into a behavior function, into which you pass the
 * stack fixture to use when running the tests. So in your <code>FunSuite</code> for stack, you'd invoke the
 * behavior function three times, passing in each of the three stack fixtures so that the shared tests are run for all three fixtures.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can define a behavior function that encapsulates these shared tests inside the <code>FunSuite</code> that uses them. If they are shared
 * between different <code>FunSuite</code>s, however, you could also define them in a separate trait that is mixed into
 * each <code>FunSuite</code> that uses them.
 * <a name="StackBehaviors">For</a> example, here the <code>nonEmptyStack</code> behavior function (in this case, a
 * behavior <em>method</em>) is defined in a trait along with another
 * method containing shared tests for non-full stacks:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * 
 * trait FunSuiteStackBehaviors { this: FunSuite =>
 * 
 *   def nonEmptyStack(createNonEmptyStack: => Stack[Int], lastItemAdded: Int) {
 * 
 *     test("empty is invoked on this non-empty stack: " + createNonEmptyStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonEmptyStack
 *       assert(!stack.empty)
 *     }
 * 
 *     test("peek is invoked on this non-empty stack: " + createNonEmptyStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonEmptyStack
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.peek === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size)
 *     }
 * 
 *     test("pop is invoked on this non-empty stack: " + createNonEmptyStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonEmptyStack
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       assert(stack.pop === lastItemAdded)
 *       assert(stack.size === size - 1)
 *     }
 *   }
 *   
 *   def nonFullStack(createNonFullStack: => Stack[Int]) {
 *       
 *     test("full is invoked on this non-full stack: " + createNonFullStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonFullStack
 *       assert(!stack.full)
 *     }
 *       
 *     test("push is invoked on this non-full stack: " + createNonFullStack.toString) {
 *       val stack = createNonFullStack
 *       val size = stack.size
 *       stack.push(7)
 *       assert(stack.size === size + 1)
 *       assert(stack.peek === 7)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given these behavior functions, you could invoke them directly, but <code>FunSuite</code> offers a DSL for the purpose,
 * which looks like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * testsFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed))
 * testsFor(nonFullStack(stackWithOneItem))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If you prefer to use an imperative style to change fixtures, for example by mixing in <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> and
 * reassigning a <code>stack</code> <code>var</code> in <code>beforeEach</code>, you could write your behavior functions
 * in the context of that <code>var</code>, which means you wouldn't need to pass in the stack fixture because it would be
 * in scope already inside the behavior function. In that case, your code would look like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * testsFor(nonEmptyStack) // assuming lastValuePushed is also in scope inside nonEmptyStack
 * testsFor(nonFullStack)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The recommended style, however, is the functional, pass-all-the-needed-values-in style. Here's an example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * import org.scalatest.FunSuite
 * 
 * class StackFunSuite extends FunSuite with FunSuiteStackBehaviors {
 * 
 *   // Stack fixture creation methods
 *   def emptyStack = new Stack[Int]
 *  
 *   def fullStack = {
 *     val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *     for (i <- 0 until stack.MAX)
 *       stack.push(i)
 *     stack
 *   }
 *  
 *   def stackWithOneItem = {
 *     val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *     stack.push(9)
 *     stack
 *   }
 *  
 *   def stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity = {
 *     val stack = new Stack[Int]
 *     for (i <- 1 to 9)
 *       stack.push(i)
 *     stack
 *   }
 *  
 *   val lastValuePushed = 9
 *  
 *   test("empty is invoked on an empty stack") {
 *     val stack = emptyStack
 *     assert(stack.empty)
 *   }
 *
 *   test("peek is invoked on an empty stack") {
 *     val stack = emptyStack
 *     intercept[IllegalStateException] {
 *       stack.peek
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   test("pop is invoked on an empty stack") {
 *     val stack = emptyStack
 *     intercept[IllegalStateException] {
 *       emptyStack.pop
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   testsFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed))
 *   testsFor(nonFullStack(stackWithOneItem))
 *
 *   testsFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity, lastValuePushed))
 *   testsFor(nonFullStack(stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity))
 *
 *   test("full is invoked on a full stack") {
 *     val stack = fullStack
 *     assert(stack.full)
 *   }
 *
 *   testsFor(nonEmptyStack(fullStack, lastValuePushed))
 *
 *   test("push is invoked on a full stack") {
 *     val stack = fullStack

 *       stack.push(10)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *

 * <p>
 * One thing to keep in mind when using shared tests is that in ScalaTest, each test in a suite must have a unique name.
 * If you register the same tests repeatedly in the same suite, one problem you may encounter is an exception at runtime
 * complaining that multiple tests are being registered with the same test name.
 * In a <code>FunSuite</code> there is no nesting construct analogous to <code>Spec</code>'s <code>describe</code> clause.
 * Therefore, you need to do a bit of
 * extra work to ensure that the test names are unique. If a duplicate test name problem shows up in a
 * <code>FunSuite</code>, you'll need to pass in a prefix or suffix string to add to each test name. You can pass this string
 * the same way you pass any other data needed by the shared tests, or just call <code>toString</code> on the shared fixture object.
 * This is the approach taken by the previous <code>FunSuiteStackBehaviors</code> example.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given this <code>FunSuiteStackBehaviors</code> trait, calling it with the <code>stackWithOneItem</code> fixture, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * testsFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItem, lastValuePushed))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * yields test names:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>empty is invoked on this non-empty stack: Stack(9)</code></li>
 * <li><code>peek is invoked on this non-empty stack: Stack(9)</code></li>
 * <li><code>pop is invoked on this non-empty stack: Stack(9)</code></li>

 * </p>
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * testsFor(nonEmptyStack(stackWithOneItemLessThanCapacity, lastValuePushed))
 * </pre>
