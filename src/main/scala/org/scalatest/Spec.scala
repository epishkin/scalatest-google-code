/**
 * <strong>Spec has been deprecated and will be used for a different purpose in a future
 * version of ScalaTest. Please change any uses of <code>org.scalatest.Spec</code>
 * to a corresponding use of <a href="FunSpec.html"><code>org.scalatest.FunSpec</code></a>.
 * This is just a name change, so all you need to do is add <code>Fun</code> in front of <code>Spec</code>.</strong>
 *
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this change is to allow the name <code>Spec</code> to be later used
 * for a behavior-driven development style in which tests are methods, which eliminates
 * one generated class file per test.
