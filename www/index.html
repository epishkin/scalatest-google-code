<h1>Description of Project for Approval Process</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is an alternative language on the JVM that blends functional and object oriented concepts in a statically typed language. I have been working for a few months on a JUnit-like testing tool for Scala, because no good testing tool like that exists as yet. I basically refactored and translated the code for a testing tool I wrotemany years back in Java called SuiteRunner. ScalaTest will allow Scala and Java programmers to write very concise tests, helping them reduce the burden of code size that JUnit (and JUnit 4 and TestNG as well) tests require. So it is a tool that I'd like to provide to Java programmers as well as Scala programmers. The code exists and is almost ready for letting the public take a look at it. I'd like to make it available at least for public consumption via a subversion repository here within a few days if possible.

Thanks for considering and hopefully approving this project.
